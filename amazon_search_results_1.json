Nivea has been my holy grail in terms of skin care up until recently.\n\nThis version of Cetaphil scrub has safer and better ingredients than the more popular gentle cleanser.\n\nOne of the most noticeable advantages this has over Nivea is the moisture retention you get on your face post using this product. This seldom makes your face dry and visible differences can be seen right after the first use.\n\nPlus, it has been bamboo and coconut extracts which are very good for your face.\n\nQuality: 5/5\nQuantity: 5/5\nPackaging: 4/5\nEffectiveness: 5/5\n\nThe product is made in Germany. No wonder it\u2019s so good."

Perfect for sensitive skin prone to breakouts and redness (hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic).\n\nThe tube in itself is sturdy and compact.\n\nConsistency - watery gel with mild granulations.\n\nAmount required - very, very little (which makes the price worth it. It'll last you for ages.)\n\nScent - clean and refreshing, one of the main things that attracted me.\n\nLather - not bubbly, but obvious.\n\nWashing off - wash off at least twice to remove the residue. In my experience, that's how much is required.\n\nFeel - a thorough cleanse. Skin may feel a little tight subsequently, but that's the case with most soaps or facewashes."

Me gusta mas para el invierno que para el verano, pero eso va en gustos. No hace casi espuma. F\u00e1cil de retirar del rostro, con una esponjita. F\u00e1cil de aclarar. El dosificador tambi\u00e9n es otro punto a favor. En la composici\u00f3n lleva 3 ceramidas, otro punto a su favor. Pero creo que lo que mas me gusta es que cuando me lavo el rostro no noto la tirantez de otros limpiadores, y que es hidratante. Este esta indicado para piel seca o normal. Hay otra versi\u00f3n para piel grasa/mixta, de color aguamarina. No tiene perfume y la textura es como un gel. Estos \u00faltimos d\u00edas lo he visto por 9 euros."

Mi piel tiende a resecarse con facilidad y a veces incluso se irrita con otros productos, pero con este limpiador no he tenido ese problema. No me ha causado resequedad ni sensaci\u00f3n de picor, algo que valoro much\u00edsimo.\n\nAunque es un limpiador espumoso, no lo encuentro abrasivo en absoluto. Deja la piel limpia y fresca sin esa sensaci\u00f3n de tirantez que otros productos suelen causar. Lo he estado usando tanto para la cara como para el cuerpo y, hasta ahora, mi piel ha respondido muy bien.

Tant'\u00e8 vero che io, dopo anni di trattamenti e prodotti sbagliati e aggressivi, ero arrivata ad avere una pelle screpolata intorno al naso e la bocca e la pelle in generale molto sensibile e reattiva ad ogni cosa. Dopo un solo mese di detersione mattina e sera (accompagnato da una semplice crema idratante alla sera e la crema solare durante il giorno) ho potuto veder scomparire le pellicine ed essere felice di avere di nuovo una pelle la cui barriera riesce a proteggermi.\n\nPs. Comprato l'8 maggio 2020 e sto scrivendo la recensione il 12 settembre 2020; ho ancora un quarto del flacone nonostante l'abbia usato religiosamente mattina e sera, tutti i giorni. La mia pelle \u00e8 rimpolpata, non ha fastidi e non reagisce pi\u00f9 arrossandosi continuamente ad ogni piccolo tocco. Fate voi!"

I have struggled with oily skin for years, constantly dealing with that midday shine and occasional breakouts. This cleanser has truly helped balance my skin.\n\nThe formula is gentle but effective, removing excess oil and impurities without leaving my face feeling stripped or dry. I love that it includes ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which help to keep my skin hydrated and maintain its natural barrier. After using this cleanser, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and soft.\n\nI\u2019ve also noticed a significant reduction in breakouts and overall oiliness throughout the day. It has a nice, light lather and rinses off easily, leaving no residue behind. If you have oily or combination skin, I highly recommend giving CeraVe a try. It\u2019s made a noticeable difference for me, and I\u2019ll definitely be sticking with it!"

This cleanser is formulated for normal to oily skin, which is perfect for my skin type. I love that it\u2019s fragrance-free, so it\u2019s gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn\u2019t cause any irritation.\n\nThe foaming gel texture is refreshing, and it does an excellent job at removing oil and impurities without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. I especially appreciate the inclusion of ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid. The ceramides help maintain my skin\u2019s protective barrier, while hyaluronic acid keeps it hydrated. Niacinamide has also been great for reducing the appearance of my pores and evening out my skin tone."

I wouldn't believe this if I were to read it myself. The best part for me though (age 50) I swear I noticed a significant improvement in the overall texture and clarity of my skin with the first use!!! I wish I would've heard of this long ago, but better late than never! I have never written a review like this before, sorry for the lengthy context but this product wowed me! I had to!!

I did tons of research and attempted to find the best products that were effective but also would not break the bank. I came upon this company and fell in love with their quality and price point. After only using this product for a few short weeks I was amazed the progress my skin had made for not being as prescription skin product. I will continue to use this product and cant recommend it enough. Its definitely gentle and simple."

I have dealt with combination (oily and dry) skin and hormonal acne my whole life meaning I break out a lot and I have noticed a HUGE difference since switching to beauty of joseon. My skin is no longer irritated or dried out and it\u2019s so smoother than ever and I only have breakouts when I am not consistently using it 2x a day. I have tried proactiv, artistry, cerave, and many more. I tell everyone to switch to this brand. You do have to be consistent 2x a day. I use this cleanser, rice milk toner, glow serum, gel moisturizer and an occasional bean paste mask."

                "review": "Update: I stopped double cleansing when I wear sunscreen and used just this by itself and it does so lovely on my skin! The problem I had was not only when I double cleanse my skin doesn't like that so instead I cleanse with BOJ balm or this gel cleanser and then use a toner to make sure everything is removed. But the other problem was when I used it with the water too warm and it flared my rosacea. For the last few evenings I've used this without any other cleanser and lukewarm or cool water and my skin does so much better. Just love BOJ!\n\n---Original review ---\n\nI don't use this BOJ Green Plum cleanser every day. This is only for those occasions when I double cleanse after wearing a particularly heavy SPF sunscreen, or maybe if I wear makeup (which is rare since I work remotely).\n\nIt's a little drying for my dry aging skin. If you have more oily skin, you may love this. I am biased to Beauty of Joseon products, so basically they can do no wrong - lol - but this isn't my favorite cleanser since it is a little drying. Though they do indicate it is 'pore cleansing' so that should have been my clue!\n\nI love BOJ ginseng oil based cleanser. And their cleansing balm. Those are my go-tos. I use the oil based cleanser every day. I'll use the balm as the first step in double cleansing or use it on its own for makeup or SPF removal.\n\nI won't reorder this but it's not because it is not a great cleanser, it's just not for my aging rosacea-prone skin type."

The cleansing action is pretty gentle but feels effective as a cleanser without drying or irritation. The ingredients seem decent, with a few natural herbs inside. There is a neutral smell that is of light strength and ok, it is a kind of generic cleanser type of smell with a hint of the herbal ingredients, it only appears when applying to the face but goes away after washing.\n\nOverall adequate enough for me to integrate into my morning and night face wash routine."

                "review": "I don't suffer from acne but I do like to use a exfoliating cleanser a few times a week, so I ordered this BHA Acne Foam Cleansing made by NatureONE.\n\nThe main blemish busters in this cleanser are lauric acid and salicylic acid. Salicylic acid has been around forever and is a proven success for fighting acne, but newer studies have shown that lauric acid also has a lot of potential for attaining clear skin. In addition to those, this product also contains the antibacterial chlorphenesin, and a good blend of humectants and emollients.\n\nI had hoped that the hydrating and moisturizing ingredients in this cleanser would help it to not dry out my skin so much. It's definitely a trade-off - after using this cleanser my skin does feel tight and slightly dry but it's worth it to me for the benefit of the BHA in it. And besides, I always moisturize after cleansing.\n\nThere is no added fragrance in this cleanser but it does smell of the peppermint oil that it contains. It has decent foaming action and I love that the surfactants and preservatives used are not harsh. It is a pretty clean formula with no sulfates, parabens, cyclic silicones or fragrance, but it does contain polyethylene glycol in the form of PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil. The issue with PEGs is that during their creation toxic byproducts are released, which can then contaminate the final product. These toxic byproducts include ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen and 1,4-dioxane, a suspected carcinogen. I avoid skin care products with PEGs, so after using this cleanser a couple times I have stopped.\n\nCurrently this cleanser is selling for $18.95 and that is a pretty good deal considering all the good ingredients it contains. One star docked for the presence of a PEG, but other than that it is a nice cleanser."

A big bonus to me is my dry zones are less dry and my oily zones are clean and less shiny. It rinsed off easily and left my face feeling slightly tingly and very clean.

I have very oily skin that gets an occasional breakout but it's not anything that's out of control. Either way, my pores do get a bit clogged from time to time, especially during the cooler fall and winter months. First off all, going on, this is the most cooling moisturizer I've ever tried and it's so soothing on my skin. I'm thankful it's not overly drying, nor have I had a bad reaction to it at all. I'm guessing the balance of acids, glycerin, castor oil and other skin loving ingredients really help me out here. Regardless, I'm liking what I'm seeing and I think I may have found a new favorite!"

I can feel the effect on my skin 30 minutes after cleaning it. It almost has a tightening feel. I'm looking forward to the next few weeks to see if it also helps stop acne breakouts."

                "review": "I'm giving NatureOne's BHA AcneFoam Cleanser a five star review because it leaves my skin feeling super clean and rejuvenated, with a noticeable skin clearing and brightening effect. The fragrance is invigorating - pure, clean mint. Nothing mediciney here, it's very natural peppermint. The cleanser is a creamy silky lotion that foams up into a serious lather. Only a small amount of product is needed to wash the face, the lather is very rich. Skin feels soft and supple once the foam is rinsed away. I've noticed a reduction in breakouts and dullness since washing with this cleanser twice daily and it causes no irritation or sensitivity to my skin. The tube is a fairly generous 100ml or 3.38 fl. oz., and this cleanser is a good deal because you only need a small amount to get super clean."

Whatever soothing ingredients are in here seem to tone down redness and inflammation, leaving my skin more even-toned and smooth. I\u2019m hoping it helps keep my hormonal cystic acne at bay!

It\u2019s super gentle on the skin but still leaves my face feeling clean without that tight, dry feeling afterward.\n\nThe scent is kind of herbal/tea tree-ish, not super strong, but worth mentioning in case you're sensitive to fragrance. Personally, I don\u2019t mind it. The gel texture is really nice and easy to work into the skin, and it rinses off easily too.\n\nIt works well for my dry skin, clears away the overnight dirt in the morning, and it\u2019s also great as a second cleanser at night. Doesn\u2019t mess with my skin barrier or cause breakouts, which is a big win for me.\n\nOverall, a great everyday cleanser that\u2019s affordable and reliable. If you like your skincare simple but effective, this is a solid choice."

I have sensitive, combination skin, and it\u2019s hard to find a cleanser that cleans without stripping my face. This one ticks all the boxes\u2014it\u2019s gentle, effective, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without any tightness.\n\nThe low pH formula really helps maintain my skin\u2019s balance, which is important to avoid breakouts and irritation. I also love that it contains tea tree oil and BHA, which keep my pores clear and calm any redness. Even though it\u2019s called a \u201cmorning\u201d cleanser, I use it both day and night, and it works beautifully every time.\n\nThe gel texture feels soothing, and it lathers just the right amount without being too foamy. Plus, the 150 ml bottle lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long way. It\u2019s also fragrance-free, which is a bonus for those with sensitive skin or anyone avoiding strong scents.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a reliable, gentle daily cleanser that works for all skin types\u2014especially sensitive or acne-prone\u2014this one is a must-try! I\u2019ll definitely be repurchasing."

Also the tea tree smell is quite strong so if you're not a fan, I wouldn't recommend this. It is good at cleansing my skin without stripping it so far, but I'll have to use it for more than a month to see if it has any additional skin benefits like it claims to.\nOverall, it seems like a really great product for the price."

                "review": "I was a bit skeptical because of the horror stories I have seen on YouTube and other reviews but I\u2019m really glad I went for it because this product doesnt irritate my skin or make me break out at all. In fact, every time I use it (I use it at night even though it says good morning which is totally fine) it leaves my skin with this slight glow, which is awesome! It doesn\u2019t strip my skin at all like my other cleansers did which messed up my skins natural ph balance and actually CAUSED acne (Grrr skincare industry). If y\u2019all haven\u2019t looked at ph balanced products, you need to unless you want to have acne forever. If you destroy your skins natural moisture barrier and ph levels, you are essentially removing the fence your skin is trying to put up to protect itself which allows all kinds of bacteria to come in and have an acne party on your face. I\u2019m using this as a part of my skincare regimen to help restore my skins natural barrier. The product has also helped fade my acne scars and assist with redness. Sometimes I will feel a zit brewing underneath my skin and it won\u2019t even come out. I think this is due mainly to the tea tree oil and possibly the evening primrose oil in this. I honestly don\u2019t care though because whichever ingredient is responsible for doing this is working. On that note, the product definitely smells like Tea Tree oil. Some people may think the scent smells like chemicals but this is really just the natural scent pure Tea Tree oil has. I personally like it but if the smell is not for you, it doesn\u2019t linger at all. A little goes a long way with this product- it is very silky and suds up just slightly when you gently massage it into your skin. The product takes about a week to arrive at least to Texas (I think it must actually ship from Korea lol) but it was worth the wait. I would definitely recommend."

                "review": "I\u2019ve been using the ANUA Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam for a little while now, and overall, it\u2019s been a pretty good experience. The first thing I noticed is its creamy texture and how much foam it creates \u2013 a little goes a long way, and the lather feels really soft and luxurious on the skin. It\u2019s super gentle, which makes it great for daily use without stripping away moisture.\n\nWhile my skin feels refreshed and smooth after using it, I\u2019m not entirely sure if it\u2019s doing a deep cleanse for my pores as it claims. I haven\u2019t noticed a big difference in pore visibility or deep cleaning effects, but as a basic foamy cleanser, it works well for getting rid of surface impurities.\n\nIf you\u2019re looking for a soft, gentle, and foamy cleanser that leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh, this one is worth trying. Just don\u2019t expect a miracle when it comes to deep pore cleaning. Still, it\u2019s a nice product that feels good on the skin!"

Ho provato a dare una seconda chance ai prodotti, ma il problema si \u00e8 ripresentato, quindi ho deciso di restituirli.\n\nPer chi ha la pelle sensibile o reattiva, consiglio di fare molta attenzione.

The texture is silky and lightweight\u2014it glides over my skin effortlessly and melts away makeup and sunscreen without any harsh rubbing. What really impressed me, though, was how soft and smooth my skin felt afterward. No tightness, no greasy residue, just clean, calm skin.\n\nIt also has a subtle, calming scent that makes the cleansing routine feel almost spa-like. Plus, my pores look more refined and my skin feels more balanced overall. If you\u2019re into double cleansing or just want a gentle yet effective oil cleanser, I can\u2019t recommend this enough."

It has far exceeded my expectations of a face wash.\n\nI am a 42yr old melanated woman and I smoke - that makes a difference in your skin. I live in the Midwest and it's February so cold frigid dry air right now. I notice that every winter my skin has a number of issues; dry patches, irritated acne, flakey, uneven tone/ashy, and fatigued looking. My face itches for no reason. I try a mixture of tea tree oil and moisturizer, nothing. I wash my face with Cetaphil as I have for over 2 decades, nothing. I finally accepted that it was time to change my routine and products. But I'm not a big consumer of makeup or skin care. I used Cetaphil and ponds for years and it has worked. My best friend recommended this and other products to cleanse, tone, tighten, even, and SPF protector. Reluctantly I ordered it. I received it on February 14th, today is the 18th and I already am overwhelmed with hope for this face cleanser. When I got it my face was irritated and itchy so I was a little scared to try it but within the time I've had it, the irritation has greatly deminished and my face doesn't itch as much or as long. My face looks clearer and brighter. I notice I had a little white pimple on my chin 2 days ago. Usually I would've popped it but I wanted to see the product work in real time and it has. I see it literally drying up and my skin isn't crusty or flakey. When I pat my face, I can see the skin that was exfoliated simply peel or wipe away. The effectiveness of this product is exactly what I read and what I needed!\nLastly, a little goes a long way so start out with a pea sized amount and if you need to go up(which you shouldn't) DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH! I paid less for this than Cetaphil, so the price makes me super happy and it will last just as long.\n\n**Open your pores with hot water but rinse with cooler water. Pat dry."

If I hadn\u2019t done that there would have been a huge waste. I am going to order another tube knowing this, because I really liked the face wash."

I\u2019ve bought pretty much every product I could find for oily skin from clean and clear to la roche posay and Paula\u2019s choice. This product is amazing!!!!! Usually within an hour or two after washing my face it already starts feeling oily and gross. I\u2019ve used it for two days now and can already see and feel a HUGE difference. My skin is super smooth, I don\u2019t feel like I need to wash my face again hours after I use it, I can already see less inflammation. For once in a loooong time I feel like I have normal skin.

Perfect for both face and body, especially if you have sensitive skin.\n\nWhat I liked:\n\u2714 Fragrance-free and super gentle - great for sensitive skin.\n\u2714 Doesn\u2019t strip moisture but still cleans well.\n\u2714 Works on both face and body, so it\u2019s versatile.\n\u2714 Huge 1L bottle lasts ages - good value for money.\n\nWhat I didn\u2019t like:\n\u2718 Doesn\u2019t foam, so it might feel different if you\u2019re used to bubbly cleansers.\n\u2718 Might not remove heavy makeup completely - best paired with a makeup remover.\n\nIf you need a no-fuss, gentle cleanser that works for daily use, this one\u2019s a winner!"

                "review": "My Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (1L) arrived on time and was in good condition (now, mostly used). Thank you Amazon (Au) for same day dispatch and Amazon Logistics for a fast, personal and safe delivery.\n\nMy face began to feel tight and hard as though it had been starched after using my usual cleanser, for some time. I knew that I needed to change to another more gentle cleanser. I tried using a little Sorbolene cream, but found that its oily / greasy character required extensive rinsing. Very inconvenient.\n\nLuckily, Amazon had Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser on a deal. So I tried it. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has a smooth consistency. It doesn't feel oily or greasy (unlike sorbolene). Cetaphil has the viscosity of a lotion. It is easily spread over the skin, leaving it well coated. There is little wastage from dripping / falling off the skin like some other thicker cleansers. It can be readily washed or wiped off the skin.\n\nPersonally, l like to apply my cleanser to damp / wet skin. Upon use, I found Cetaphil to be a soothing, non irritating cleanser that left my face feeling clean and refreshed, without any skin tightness. What a relief from the worry of trying to find a suitable cleanser for a reasonable price.\n\nAn effective cleanser that leaves the natural oils / fats necessary for good skin health, whilst leaving the skin feeling clean."

                "review": "I have very sensitive skin that breaks out super easily and leans more on the dry side. It's been difficult to find a face wash I can use everyday that didn't dry out or irritate my face. From the top of my head I've tried the face shop foaming cleanser, cetaphil, olehenrikson, and kiehls (latest), and they all had varying problems. Kiehl's made my skin a bit better, but it wasn't something I was able to use everyday as it dried it out too much.\n\nThis is the only cleanser so far that I can use twice a day which doesn't leave my skin feeling overly tight, have dry spots, make my face red/itchy, or break out in skin colored bumps. My face normally can't stand using a face wash twice a day (or even washing twice a day), however it tolerates this one. It doesn't have a very distracting scent (its very slight) and cleans my skin adequately. It feels fresh, clean, and gentle. It's a bit hard to squeeze out of the bottle, but you don't need to use so much anyway and it lathers easily enough. I'm really happy I finally found something that doesn't make my skin angry."

Here\u2019s a review:\n\n1. **Gentle Formula**: This facial cleanser is known for its mildness, making it suitable for various skin types, including sensitive skin. The formula is gentle enough for daily use, helping to remove dirt, oil, and impurities without stripping the skin or causing irritation.\n\n2. **Key Ingredients**: The product features **Dokdo Water**, sourced from the pristine Dokdo Island in South Korea, which is rich in minerals and has soothing properties. This helps hydrate the skin while cleansing, leaving your face feeling fresh and balanced.\n\n3. **Texture**: The cleanser has a smooth, slightly gel-like consistency that lathers well and feels light on the skin. It doesn\u2019t leave any residue behind and doesn\u2019t feel tight or dry after use, which is a big plus for those with dry or sensitive skin.\n\n4. **Fragrance**: The product has a very subtle, fresh scent that isn\u2019t overpowering, making it suitable for those who prefer fragrance-free or lightly scented skincare products.\n\n5. **Packaging**: The 150 ml (5.07 fl.oz) size is compact and easy to use, with a convenient flip-top cap for dispensing the product. It's a good size for both daily use and travel.\n\n**Overall**: The ROUND LAB 1025 DOKDO Facial Cleanser offers a refreshing, hydrating cleanse without being harsh on the skin. If you're looking for a gentle, mineral-rich cleanser that cleanses and nourishes, this one is worth trying!"

I have combo skin that's dry immediately after cleansing, but then gets oily in the t-zone throughout the day. I normally use non- or low-foaming cleansers with pH 5.5-ish as they're not drying after I finish cleansing.\n\nSocial media got me to try this cleanser since so many people were claiming it was foamy, but non-drying. While it is definitely very foamy, with a thick, velvety foam, it was drying on my skin.\n\nI use it as a second cleanser after an oil cleanser and it seems to work well as a second cleanser. It has a faintest plasticky scent which does not bother me.\n\nWhile it's not an ideal cleanser for my preference, I'll continue to use it up."

                "review": "I am in LOVE with this cleanser! I usually use ROUND LAB's birch juice cleanser, but I wanted to try something new. This did not disappoint!\n\nPackaging:\nOn point. Super cute, yet simple. There are instructions in English on the unicarton and Korean instructions on the actual product. The ingredients are clearly listed and the produst itself was sealed.\n\nUse:\nPretty straightforward stuff, wet, lather, and rinse, right? That being said, this cleanser is a bit different. It DOES lather up, but with the addition of deep sea salt, the lather disappates quickly, (So yeah, that picture was taken rather QUICKLY) but of course, a little more water, and you're good to go! As with most ROUND LAB products, a little really does go a long way, so you really don't need to use a ton of product to get the good results! The formula is nice and soft, easy on, easy off and... it's hard to explain, but after rinsing, my face did \"dry down\" but it wasn't \"dry-dry\" (I hope that makes sense!)\n\nNotes:\nOne thing I did notice that isn't a detractor or anything, is that the Sea Salt DOES act as a micro-exfoliant. So definitely be aware of that if you're sensitive to those sorts of things. I do believe it's safe to use for daily use, though, I won't personally be using it during my nighttime routine, just my morning one. (I'm also not a professional, so take that with a grain of Deep Sea Salt!)\n\nOverall:\nRound Lab has done it again! And for someone with Oily/Combo skin, this, paired with the rest of their line (and other K-beauty skin products) keep my face happy and clean!"

Also a good price for the size of product.\nThe con for me is it DOES sting eyes. No matter how hard I try, because it foams up a lot, it eventually reaches my eyes by the time I\u2019m done rubbing my face.\nOther than that, it is a good cleanser. I have dry sensitive skin and usually stay away from foam cleansers because they are overly drying. This one does not dry me out afterwards and my skin feels like it has bounce to it even after only cleansing.\nI think there are other good K cleansers out there that I would try before purchasing this again, but if someone has oily/sensitive skin I think this would suit them great."

No one tells you about how horrid this cleanser smells! I would have to take deep breaths before I rubbed the cleanser into my skin because the odor is just so potent. Funny thing is, the cleanser works extremely well! My skin does not feel stripped of any moisture and it does not feel tight or dry. I just cannot get over the scent, almost as though it\u2019s plastic that\u2019s burnt with an earthy scent. I\u2019m the kind of person that does not get bothered by scents of certain products but that was more than I can handle. Plus the design of the bottle is faulty, it gets difficult to squeeze out product towards the end. Tough to say whether or not you should buy this but if you can handle the smell, it is an amazing cleanser that works well for my oily/acne prone skin that can be sensitive at times!"

(Korean brand)\n\nThis cleanser obvious key ingredient is 0.05% Salicylic Acid, Laurie Acid, Teatree leaf oil, Salicylic Alba Bark Water and Glycerine.\n\nThis is design to melt away impurities, it gently removes dirt, excess oil and product build up whilst replenishing moisture. This leaves your skin feeling soft, visibly clearer and boast your skins natural glow.\n\nMy experience- my skin type is dry/sensitive\nThis has a white thick gel like texture, also has a teatree/willow scent to it.\nIt is easy to lather up with water and form into foam texture.\nI like to ensure my face is damp before I use this and and once again use this as a foam.\nI generally gently rub this around my face for about 1 min before rising off. I find this allows time for the product to work.\n\nWith my skin type I can not use this daily, as I find it too stripping. I will gently use this once or twice a week depending on the condition of my skin.\n( please note if this is drying your skin out and cause a break out, please stop and give it as rest as you are over using the product and breaking your skin barrier)"

                "review": "I purchased this product as it was finally a facial cleanser with salicylic acid available in Australia for a reasonable price. I did not expect the near on instantaneous affects of this great cleanser.\nI have struggled with moderate acne for the past few years, and have tried nearly every available drug store cleanser, toner, exfoliator etc. I had heard about the benefits of salicylic acid for acne prone skin, and looked into cleansers. Many were extremely expensive, or were only available in the US. I'm so glad I found this cleanser. I've now been using it for a month alongside my minocycline acne pills (lower level accutane like drug), and have found amazing benefits.\n-reduced redness\n-less swelling\n-smaller breakouts\n-less common breakouts\n-less oily skin\n-reduced appearance of sebaceous filaments\nWould definitely recommend this cleanser if you struggle with oily skin and acne."

I used it most nights and I started getting small breakouts on my forehead and cheeks. At first I started freaking out not understanding why my skin was getting worse. But I looked into it quite a bit and that's when I learned about skin purging. Which is what is expected to happen when you just start using BHA ingredients such as Salicylic Acid. I had never used it before. So I was patient . I kept using it. And I'm so happy I did. After a month my skin was looking better than it ever had, and I'm so happy I stuck with it ."

Made me break out worse than I ever have before, genuinlh ruined my skin. Took months for it to get back to somewhat normal. BUT this works for other people and it may just not have been suitable for my skin. If you have sensitive skin, I highly recommend staying away from this product, it's not worth the risk"

As an individual navigating the challenges of oily skin, I found that this otherwise remarkable palette presented some drawbacks worth noting. Despite its enchanting range of shades and seamless blending capabilities, the luminous finish of the elf Halo Glow palette tends to accentuate the natural shine of oily skin, rather than providing a desired glow. Throughout the day, I noticed that the shimmer particles intensified the appearance of oiliness, resulting in a less-than-desirable finish. Additionally, the longevity of the highlighter proved to be an issue for oily skin. Despite initial promises of staying power, the product struggled to maintain its luminosity in the presence of excess oil, often requiring frequent touch-ups to restore its radiance. While the packaging remains sleek and travel-friendly, and the shade range caters to various skin tones, these attributes may not outweigh the challenges faced by those with oily skin. In conclusion, while the elf Halo Glow highlighting palette may be a dream for some, it may not be the ideal choice for individuals with oily skin. For those seeking a luminous finish without exacerbating oiliness, alternative options may better suit their needs.",

                "review": "La Roche-Posay's face wash stands out as a refreshing and gentle option for daily skincare routines. Having incorporated it into my regimen, I've found several aspects of the product to be commendable.\n\nFirstly, its gentle formulation is a standout feature. Suitable for sensitive skin, it cleanses effectively without causing irritation or dryness, making it a reliable choice for daily use. The absence of harsh ingredients ensures a soothing experience, particularly for those prone to sensitivity or redness.\n\nMoreover, the face wash's effectiveness in removing impurities and excess oil is noteworthy. Despite its mild nature, it lathers well and effectively cleanses the skin without stripping away its natural moisture barrier. This leaves the skin feeling clean, refreshed, and balanced after each use.\n\nAdditionally, the inclusion of La Roche-Posay's signature Thermal Spring Water adds an extra layer of hydration and comfort to the cleansing experience. This unique ingredient helps to soothe and soften the skin, contributing to a refreshed and revitalized complexion.\n\nThe packaging is practical and user-friendly, with a convenient pump dispenser that ensures easy and mess-free application. The product's dermatologist-tested and fragrance-free formula further adds to its appeal, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types, including those with sensitivities or allergies.\n\nHowever, while the face wash excels in cleansing and soothing the skin, it may not be the most effective option for removing heavy makeup or waterproof products. In such cases, a double cleanse or additional makeup remover may be necessary.\n\nIn summary, La Roche-Posay's face wash is a reliable and gentle cleanser that effectively cleanses the skin without compromising its delicate balance. Suitable for daily use, it offers a refreshing and soothing experience, making it a staple in any skincare routine."

Deshalb hatte ich am ganzen K\u00f6rper mit Pickelchen zu k\u00e4mpfen, die sich oft stark entz\u00fcndet haben. Ich habe \u00fcber Jahre hinweg, etliche Cremes und Produkte ausprobiert. Nix hat geholfen. Bis ich durch den Rat einer Apothekerin auf dieses Produkt gesto\u00dfen bin. Dieses Duschgel desinfiziert mild die Haut ohne die Haut zu reizen. Schon nach erster Benutzung ist ein anderes Hautgef\u00fchl bemerkbar. Zudem reduziert es die Fett und Talgbildung in der Haut. Entstehung neuer Pikelchen wird stark reduziert. Und die Wundheilung von entz\u00fcndeten Stellen wird stark angeregt. Ich habe seit Nutzungsbeginn dieses Duschgels fast gar keine Probleme mehr mit meiner Haut. Ein ganz neues Lebensgef\u00fchl hat man da. Ich bin mir sicher, dass es nicht jeden hilft, diese Produkt zu verwenden. Aber mit Sicherheit, wird es einigen helfen, seine Hautprobleme in den Griff zu bekommen. Apotheken bieten kostenlose Produkt Proben zum Ausprobieren an. Viel Spa\u00df beim Ausprobieren!!! Ich will nicht mehr ohne!!!"

Parto dal fatto che ho una pelle super sensibile e soggetta a dermatite quindi credevo non facesse al caso mio visto che \u00e8 consigliato prevalentemente per chi ha pelle con impurit\u00e0. Nonostante ci\u00f2 ho deciso di provarlo perch\u00e9 a causa della mascherina si sono venuti a formare delle fastidiose bollicine quindi volevo un prodotto detergente ma non super aggressivo. Ho iniziato a usarlo quasi tutte le sere abbinato a una crema idratante e ad apposite creme per la dermatite (la roche ds) e il risultato mi ha piacevolmente sorpresa. La pelle appare da subito freschissima e pulitissima, basta davvero pochissimo prodotto (proprio una goccia) e fa tantissima schiuma. Consiglio prima di sciacquare il viso con acqua tiepida e dopo mettere il prodotto su tutto il viso e massaggiare bene fino a quando non esce la schiuma, infine lasciare in posa per 1 minuto o 2 senza toccare e poi sciacquare con acqua. Inoltre Consiglio questo prodotto a tutte le ragazze che usano la lametta sulle gambe e hanno quei fastidiosi puntini rossi sulla pelle dovuti alla depilazione, usatelo spesso e vedrete che scompariranno piano piano"

                "review": "I have combination to oily skin. Before using La Roche Posay, I had bumps all over my forehead because of my bangs (which I've had for over 6 years) and I got so disgusted looking at my forehead I needed to do something about it and invest in a good cleanser that was inexpensive. I used to use St. Ives, Clean and Clear, and Neutrogena then my friend let me try some of her La Roche Posay products and I absolutely loved it and bought this cleanser ASAP.\n\nAfter using this cleanser for about two weeks I noticed a difference in my skin and it was clearing up (especially my forehead). I was happy with my purchase. It's super gentle on my sensitive skin and the product lasts a long time. After three months of using this product I found out what works for me.\n\nSome tips and tricks with using this product\n- Know your skin type!!!\n- Remove any makeup before washing your face\n- rinse your face with warm water and wash the cleanser off with warm water. After washing, splash your face with COLD water\n- Make sure to activate the product in your hands before applying it on the face, don't apply it directly after taking the product out\n- wash your face for a sold minute and a half to ensure a good cleansing\n- ALWAYS MOISTURIZE RIGHT AFTER CLEANSING OR CONTINUE WITH YOUR SKIN CARE ROUTINE\n- If you're more combo than oily, only use this cleanser once a day or else it will dry our your skin. If you want to cleanse twice a day, invest in a lighter formula of this cleanser.\n\nIf you don't moisturize right after or continue with your skin care routine, you won't notice a visible difference. Always hydrate the skin after cleansing. If you're looking for immediate results, this might not be your product. For me with most products, I notice a difference after consistent uses up to two weeks. Patience is key with trying new skin care products because your skin needs to get used to what you're putting on it. Knowing your skin type helps a lot too with finding cleansers and products that will suit your skin needs.\n\nOverall, this cleanser from La Roche Posay works for me and I absolutely love the results from it. If you're not into scents or smells, this product has a very light scent. Not fruity, or strong just smells refreshing."

When first opening the bottle, I was really put off by how fragranced the gel wash is. It's not a bad smell (very perfume-y), but highly fragranced face washes tend to dry my skin out (which it did eventually). For the first month and a half, I used this with an exfoliating battery operated facial brush since my skin doesn't self-exfoliate very well. It worked okay with getting make up and everything, but I was still breaking out a lot. I kept using the wash but opted to use it sans-facial brush. This seemed to work a lot better, and didn't dry my face out as much. For about another 3 months, my skin was pretty great. Until the colder weather came around and it sucked any remaining moisture out of my skin. Basically - it's a nice facial cleanser for the warmer months. It's good for getting makeup and sweat/oil off, but does tend to dry my combination skin out."

Mein R\u00fccken, Dekollet\u00e9 und mein Gesicht waren total fettig und mit vielen Pickeln bedeckt. Leider war ich jung und naiv und durch sehr mangelnder Hygiene habe ich mich nicht weiter darum gek\u00fcmmert, meine Mutter leider auch nicht. Im Alter von 16 Jahren habe ich mir mehr Gedanken dar\u00fcber gemacht und mal geschaut welchen Hauttyp ich doch entspreche. Leider habe ich irgendwie immer auf trockene Haut getippt dabei war das total falsch. Ich habe mir dementsprechend auch Produkte f\u00fcr trockene oder Mischhaut gekauft, dies f\u00fchrte nat\u00fcrlich nur dazu das sich meine Haut extrem austrocknete und ich anschlie\u00dfend mehr Talg produziert habe, meine Poren sich verstopft haben und ich nat\u00fcrlich noch mehr Pickel bekam. Also wie ihr seht, sehr dumm war ich schon.\nIch habe massig viele Produkte aus Drogeriem\u00e4rkten probiert und alle sind irgendwie schei\u00dfe, vor allem gibt es nur Produkte f\u00fcr trockene, sehr trockene oder Mischhaut. Ich habe mich mal anschlie\u00dfend im Internet schlau gemacht und festgestellt das ich an fettiger Haut leide, dementsprechend machte ich mich auf die Suche nach Produkten.\n\n\u00dcBER DAS PRODUKT:\n\nIch bin auf La Roche-Posay gesto\u00dfen und mir mal einiges dar\u00fcber durchgelesen. Es \u00fcberzeugte mich schon sehr also habe ich mir das Reinigungsgel, eine Creme, ein Peeling und ein Anti-Pickelmale Creme gekauft. Man muss schon sagen es ging schon etwas (ca. 80\u20ac) aufs Geld aber ich versichere euch es hat sich extrem gelohnt. Ich besitze die Produkte seit einer Woche und ich sehe Tag f\u00fcr Tag immer mehr unterschied. Klar, seine Zeit braucht es immer, aber man merkt in der Zeit ein recht gutes Ergebnis. Ich habe wie gesagt mit vielen Produkten zu tun gehabt und es verschlimmerte meistens nur das Ergebnis. Es ist sehr angenehm, es riecht gut und die Haut fettet nicht nach, ich verwende das Gel morgens und abends und anschlie\u00dfend auch die Anti-Pickelmal Creme.\n\nMEIN KLEINER TIPP:\n\nIch bin sehr \u00fcberzeugt und kann es wirklich weiter empfehlen wer an fettige/\u00f6lige Haut mit Mitessern und Pickeln leidet.\nSchaut bitte erst nach, welcher Hauttyp ihr seit bevor ihr euch die falschen Produkte zulegt. Wenn euch dementsprechend nichts Hilft dann ist ein Besuch beim Hautsarzt notwendig, vor allem bei Personen die unter Akne leidet, lasst es euch regelm\u00e4\u00dfig untersuchen, es ist nicht damit zu Spa\u00dfen und achtet darauf wie ihr euch ern\u00e4hrt, also ist ein McDonalds besuch besser zu vermeiden, oder Chips und sonstige S\u00fc\u00dfigkeiten."

Pr\u00e1cticamente no tengo ninguna cicatriz (no llevo maquillaje en las fotos), y el brote ha desaparecido.\nLo recomiendo much\u00edsimo, junto a la hidratante que he comentado antes."

                "review": "Als langj\u00e4hriger Kunde von Paula's Choice bin ich erneut begeistert von diesem hervorragenden Reinigungsgel. Der CLEAR Gesichtsreiniger ist ein wahrer Allrounder, der nicht nur gr\u00fcndlich Make-up entfernt, sondern auch gegen Unreinheiten vorgeht und \u00fcbersch\u00fcssigen Talg reduziert.\n\nDas Beste an diesem Produkt ist jedoch, dass es sanft zur Haut ist und gleichzeitig sehr wirksam gegen Pickel und andere Unreinheiten ist. Der enthaltene Wirkstoff Salicyls\u00e4ure ist ein echtes Wundermittel gegen Mitesser und andere Hautprobleme. Das Reinigungsgel hinterl\u00e4sst meine Haut erfrischt und gepflegt, ohne dass es sich trocken oder gereizt anf\u00fchlt.\n\nBesonders beeindruckt hat mich die Wirkung von Panthenol / Vitamin B5. Es speichert Feuchtigkeit und verbessert das Erscheinungsbild meiner Haut deutlich. Ich habe bemerkt, dass meine Haut sich glatter und strahlender anf\u00fchlt, seit ich diesen Reiniger benutze.\n\nDie Anwendung ist sehr einfach und schnell. Ich befeuchte mein Gesicht mit lauwarmem Wasser und verteile dann eine haselnussgro\u00dfe Menge des Reinigers auf meinen Fingerspitzen. Ich massiere ihn sanft mit kreisenden Bewegungen in mein Gesicht und um die Augen herum ein, bevor ich ihn gr\u00fcndlich abwasche.\n\nDas Beste an diesem Reiniger ist, dass er f\u00fcr alle Hauttypen geeignet ist, auch f\u00fcr empfindliche und trockene Haut. Das Gel enth\u00e4lt keine scharfen Inhaltsstoffe und ist wasserl\u00f6slich. Es trocknet meine Haut nicht aus und eignet sich perfekt f\u00fcr die Gesichtsreinigung unter der Dusche oder in der Badewanne.\n\nIch bin auch sehr gl\u00fccklich dar\u00fcber, dass alle Produkte von Paula's Choice parf\u00fcmfrei sind und niemals an Tieren getestet werden. Das gibt mir ein gutes Gef\u00fchl und ich kann die Produkte mit gutem Gewissen verwenden.\n\nZusammenfassend kann ich nur sagen, dass der CLEAR Gesichtsreiniger von Paula's Choice ein absoluter Top-Produkt ist. Er ist effektiv, sanft zur Haut und f\u00fcr alle Hauttypen geeignet. Ich kann ihn jedem empfehlen, der nach einem zuverl\u00e4ssigen Reiniger sucht, der Unreinheiten und Pickel bek\u00e4mpft und gleichzeitig die Haut pflegt."

Nessun profumo, oli essenziali o altri ingredienti che potrebbero irritare la pelle. Non so se \u00e8 ideale per le pelli molto secche perch\u00e9 non \u00e8 particolarmente idratante, ma per chi ha la pelle secca a tendenza acneica lo userei a giorni alterni."

Also contains SA albeit in small amounts and has to be washed off (compared to other more effective topical leave-on SA products). However, the bottle is absolutely terrible; first of, it leaks when traveling so you have to make sure it is ALWAYS in an upright position so traveling abroad with this thing is a no-no (unless you don't mind a leakage). Secondly, the bottle cap broke a month after using it and I didn't even do anything to it, no twisting, no opening/closing - it just broke off. If you have a different bottle you can decant the product into - go for it. Otherwise, expect breaks, leakages, etc. when getting this product."

Benutze dieses Produkt in Verbindung mit dem BHA Liquid Peeling und dem C15 Booster. Vorab muss ich sagen, ich hatte nie WIRKLICH schlechte Haut. Aber war auch nie zufrieden. Immer wieder traten Unreinheiten auf. Jedoch seit ich diese Produkte benutze bin ich wirklich wunschlos gl\u00fccklich. Ein (in meinen Augen zu dem was es war) nahezu Perfektes Hautbild. Von Freunden positiv auf dieses angesprochen worden. Mit der direkten Frage wie meine Skin-Care Routine aussieht. Deutliche Kauf Empfehlungen. Bitte macht nicht den Fehler f\u00fcr eure Haut zu sparen. Gibt viele Produkte die es nur noch schlimmer machen. Klar hat jeder einen anderen Hauttyp, aber deswegen hat PC auch ein Produkt f\u00fcr jeden."

                "review": "I have struggled with mild acne for years - not severe enough for aggressive treatments or prescriptions, but enough that I always have a noticeable breakout. This stuff really helps me keep it under control! It\u2019s not a miracle cure, no face wash is, but I\u2019ve tried a huge amount and this is one of the few that makes a real difference in minimising blemishes - I find I get fewer cystic spots. It is otherwise pleasant to use, feels refreshing but gentle and removes all traces of makeup. As with most products of this type, you will need to follow up with a moisturiser, although it\u2019s less drying than most. It\u2019s obviously more expensive than most face washes but a little goes a long way."

Lasse es immer kurz einwirken und ben\u00fctze dann weitere Produkte dieser Marke. Hab dann sehr weiche Haut und nach einer Woche schon keine Pickel und Unebenheiten mehr. Wenn ich das Gef\u00fchl habe, meine Haut hat sich beruhigt, werde ich ein etwas milderes Produkt verwenden. Ich habe eher trockene Haut mit st\u00e4ndigen Unreinheiten und ben\u00fctze bisher nur Naturkosmetik und war nur zufrieden. Bin \u00fcber einen Beautyblog auf Paulas Choice gestossen, ist nicht ganz g\u00fcnstig, aber wahnsinnig ergiebig und es wirkt. Danke an die Leute, die sich wirklich mit Inhaltsstoffe in ihren Produkten auseinandergesetzt haben und somit verzweifelten Frauen mit langem Leidensweg ( musste 45 Jahre alt werden) damit helfen."

Maybe it protects my skin as it is sticky like most sun-protective products, but it dries my skin so bad: especially close to the nose wings and cheek bones. And after some time of use, my skin got some rush spots. Probably it is an allergic reaction.

J'ai not\u00e9 une r\u00e9duction visible des imperfections apr\u00e8s quelques semaines d'utilisation r\u00e9guli\u00e8re.\n\nCe que j'appr\u00e9cie \u00e9galement, c'est son odeur neutre. Contrairement \u00e0 certains produits similaires qui peuvent \u00eatre trop parfum\u00e9s ou chimiques, ce gel moussant ne laisse aucune odeur persistante, ce qui le rend agr\u00e9able \u00e0 utiliser au quotidien.\n\nLa texture du gel mousse bien sans \u00eatre excessive, et il se rince facilement, laissant une sensation de propret\u00e9 durable. Je recommande vivement ce produit \u00e0 toutes celles et ceux qui cherchent \u00e0 purifier leur peau tout en r\u00e9duisant les imperfections, sans agresser leur \u00e9piderme.\n\nEn r\u00e9sum\u00e9, ce gel moussant de CeraVe est un excellent choix pour les peaux \u00e0 tendance acn\u00e9ique. Il offre un nettoyage en profondeur, une sensation de fra\u00eecheur et une efficacit\u00e9 visible sur les imperfections."

A 236ml originally felt small but after using it twice daily for a few weeks, the bottle is still more than half full - an incredible deal for the price it's set at. This means it'll surely last a while.\n\nIn terms of effectiveness, the product itself works wonders even after a single use. It leaves the skin feeling and looking soft and helps to deal with possibly embarrassing spots and clogged pores. In my case, it effectively removed excess oils and made the skin look great. Of course, it doesn't entirely get rid of spots - it's not magic! However, in my case, it has helped to at least reduce the amount of them or conceal them a bit.\n\nFor my oily skin, it removed the oils and made the skin feel soft rather than moisturise but this may be different on different types of skin."

Am Anfang war ich etwas skeptisch, weil ich schon viele Produkte ausprobiert habe, die nicht wirklich geholfen haben. Aber CeraVe hat mich wirklich \u00fcberrascht! Nach nur wenigen Wochen habe ich gemerkt, dass meine Haut viel reiner geworden ist und die Pickel nach und nach verschwunden sind. Besonders beeindruckt hat mich, dass das Produkt meine Haut \u00fcberhaupt nicht austrocknet \u2013 im Gegenteil, sie f\u00fchlt sich nach der Anwendung immer gut mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt und angenehm weich an. Es hinterl\u00e4sst auch kein spannendes Gef\u00fchl auf der Haut, was mir bei anderen Produkten oft passiert ist.\n\nEin weiterer gro\u00dfer Vorteil ist der Preis. CeraVe ist im Vergleich zu vielen anderen Produkten auf dem Markt ziemlich erschwinglich, und das, obwohl es wirklich eine hohe Qualit\u00e4t bietet. Man hat also das Gef\u00fchl, ein Premium-Produkt zu benutzen, ohne daf\u00fcr ein Verm\u00f6gen ausgeben zu m\u00fcssen. Auch die Anwendung ist sehr einfach: Die Konsistenz ist angenehm, es l\u00e4sst sich gut auftragen und auch leicht wieder abwaschen. Der Geruch ist zudem sehr dezent, was ich pers\u00f6nlich sehr angenehm finde, weil ich starke Parf\u00fcmierungen im Gesicht nicht mag. Alles in allem bin ich wirklich begeistert von CeraVe und werde es auf jeden Fall weiterhin verwenden. Es hat meine Hautpflege-Routine wirklich auf ein neues Level gehoben und ich kann es jedem empfehlen, der mit unreiner Haut oder Trockenheit zu k\u00e4mpfen hat!"

                "review_date": "Reviewed in Spain on 12 November 2024",
                "review": "Llevo un tiempo usando el CeraVe Blemish Control Cleanser y honestamente, ha sido un cambio positivo en mi rutina de cuidado de la piel. Como alguien que lucha con las imperfecciones y el exceso de grasa, siempre estoy buscando productos que mantengan mi piel limpia sin resecarla. Este limpiador me ha sorprendido gratamente, y aqu\u00ed explico por qu\u00e9.\n\nLimpieza Profunda y Suave\nAlgo que me ha encantado de este producto es c\u00f3mo consigue una limpieza profunda sin dejar la piel seca o tirante. He probado otros limpiadores para el acn\u00e9, pero muchos de ellos suelen ser bastante agresivos. En cambio, el limpiador de CeraVe logra limpiar los poros y controlar el sebo sin causar irritaci\u00f3n. Despu\u00e9s de usarlo, siento la piel fresca y limpia, pero no tengo esa sensaci\u00f3n inc\u00f3moda de sequedad extrema. Es un equilibrio dif\u00edcil de encontrar en productos para pieles acneicas, y aqu\u00ed creo que han acertado.\n\nIngredientes Activos y sus Beneficios\nEste limpiador tiene una combinaci\u00f3n de ingredientes que funciona muy bien. Uno de los principales es el \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico, que es ideal para desobstruir los poros y prevenir nuevos brotes. Al ser un exfoliante qu\u00edmico, no necesito usar scrubs f\u00edsicos que pueden ser demasiado abrasivos. Siento que el \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico me ayuda a mantener la piel limpia y con menos puntos negros, algo que siempre es un reto.\n\nAdem\u00e1s, tiene niacinamida, que es un ingrediente que me gusta mucho. La niacinamida ayuda a calmar la piel y a reducir el enrojecimiento, lo que es perfecto si tienes acn\u00e9 y la piel un poco irritada. Tambi\u00e9n regula el exceso de grasa, as\u00ed que he notado que mi piel est\u00e1 menos brillante a lo largo del d\u00eda.\n\nFinalmente, algo que me parece un punto fuerte son las ceramidas. Son l\u00edpidos que ayudan a mantener la barrera de la piel intacta, y esto es crucial en productos de limpieza. Muchas veces, los productos para el acn\u00e9 pueden da\u00f1ar la barrera cut\u00e1nea y dejar la piel m\u00e1s vulnerable, pero gracias a las ceramidas, noto que este limpiador es m\u00e1s respetuoso y mantiene mi piel equilibrada.\n\nTextura y Sensaci\u00f3n al Usarlo\nLa textura es otro aspecto que me gusta. Es un gel que al frotarlo en el rostro se convierte en una espuma ligera. No es demasiado espumoso, lo cual aprecio porque siento que se distribuye bien sin ser abrasivo. Despu\u00e9s de enjuagarlo, noto que mi piel se siente muy fresca y con una limpieza profunda, pero sin esa sensaci\u00f3n tirante que algunos limpiadores dejan.\n\nResultados que He Notado\nCon el uso regular, he visto mejoras en mi piel. Los brotes son menos frecuentes y cuando aparecen, son menos severos. Tambi\u00e9n siento que la textura de mi piel es m\u00e1s suave y uniforme, probablemente por el efecto de la exfoliaci\u00f3n qu\u00edmica del \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico. Me gusta que es un producto que puedo usar todos los d\u00edas sin preocuparme de que me reseque o irrite la piel.\n\nIdeal para Mi Tipo de Piel\nAunque este limpiador est\u00e1 dise\u00f1ado para pieles con tendencia acneica, creo que funciona bien para varios tipos de piel, especialmente si tienes piel mixta o grasa. Mi piel es mixta y suelo tener problemas de exceso de grasa en la zona T, pero con este limpiador noto que el control de sebo es efectivo. Incluso si tienes piel sensible, creo que funcionar\u00eda bien porque es bastante suave y tiene ingredientes calmantes.\n\nRelaci\u00f3n Calidad-Precio\nEn cuanto a la cantidad, el envase trae 236 ml, lo cual me parece bastante generoso. Necesito muy poco producto cada vez que lo uso, as\u00ed que una botella dura bastante. Considerando la calidad de los ingredientes y los resultados que obtengo, creo que tiene una excelente relaci\u00f3n calidad-precio. Adem\u00e1s, CeraVe es una marca conocida por sus f\u00f3rmulas efectivas y suaves, as\u00ed que tengo confianza en sus productos."

The foam cleanser helped but I'd still get break outs every so often. This bleamish control one has done the job so far, I've not had any further break outs since using this one so it's great and I'm about to purchase my second bottle of this one. There's no scent, it keeps my skin hydrated, where as the foam cleanser did dry it out quite a bit. This bottle is slightly smaller but it's still great value for money for the quality of the product and it leaves my skin really soft. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone."

Mi \u00e8 piaciuto subito il fatto che non avesse profumi forti o fastidiosi: \u00e8 molto delicato sulla pelle, anche se contiene acido salicilico.\n\nDopo i primi giorni, ho notato che la pelle sembrava pi\u00f9 pulita e meno lucida, soprattutto nella zona T. Non fa miracoli immediati (non aspettatevi di svegliarvi con la pelle perfetta da un giorno all\u2019altro), ma con un uso costante si vedono dei miglioramenti. Mi sembra che i pori siano meno evidenti e che le imperfezioni si asciughino pi\u00f9 in fretta.\n\nLa texture \u00e8 interessante: un gel che non fa molta schiuma, ma che si risciacqua facilmente senza lasciare residui. E l\u2019argilla purificante \u00e8 un bel tocco, perch\u00e9 non secca la pelle come pensavo, cosa che apprezzo molto dato che la mia pelle \u00e8 mista e a volte sensibile.\n\nL\u2019unica cosa \u00e8 che, se lo usi troppo spesso o senza idratare bene dopo, pu\u00f2 lasciare la pelle un po\u2019 tirata. Io lo uso una volta al giorno, la sera, e finora sta andando benissimo.\n\nPunti a favore:\n\u2022 Controlla bene la lucidit\u00e0 e lascia la pelle pulita.\n\u2022 Non irrita, nonostante gli attivi presenti.\n\u2022 Perfetto per pelli miste o grasse.\n\nPunti da migliorare:\n\u2022 La confezione \u00e8 un po\u2019 piccola per il prezzo, ma ne basta poco.\n\u2022 Meglio usarlo insieme a una buona crema idratante per evitare secchezza.\n\nIn generale, \u00e8 un prodotto che consiglio a chi vuole prendersi cura della pelle senza complicarsi troppo la vita. Basta avere un po\u2019 di pazienza per vedere i risultati!"

                "review": "J'ai r\u00e9cemment eu l'occasion de tester ce produit pour moi et je suis vraiment impressionn\u00e9 par ses r\u00e9sultats !\nAvec ses ingr\u00e9dients cl\u00e9s tels que l'Acide Salicylique, l'Argile Blanche, la Niacinamide, l'Acide Hyaluronique et les 3 C\u00e9ramides Essentiels, il offre tout ce que je cherchais pour un lavant visage !\n\nTout d'abord, l'Acide Salicylique agit en douceur pour exfolier et lisser la peau, tout en d\u00e9sobstruant les pores. L'Argile Blanche purifie efficacement la peau et aide \u00e0 r\u00e9duire l'exc\u00e8s de s\u00e9bum, ce qui est id\u00e9al pour les personnes aux prises avec des probl\u00e8mes d'acn\u00e9.\nLa pr\u00e9sence de Niacinamide dans ce produit est vraiment appr\u00e9ci\u00e9, car il offre une action anti-inflammatoire qui apaise la peau et r\u00e9duit les rougeurs (contrairement \u00e0 certaines marques avec du savon agressif). De plus, l'Acide Hyaluronique hydrate en profondeur, laissant la peau douce et souple (plus de peau ass\u00e9ch\u00e9 !).\n\nCe qui m'a particuli\u00e8rement plu, c'est que ce produit parvient \u00e0 enlever les impuret\u00e9s de la peau sans l'ass\u00e9cher. Cela est essentiel pour pr\u00e9venir l'apparition de boutons et maintenir un \u00e9quilibre optimal de l'hydratation cutan\u00e9e. Je recommande toutefois de l'utiliser une fois \u00e0 deux fois par jour pour de meilleurs r\u00e9sultats, car une trop forte utilisation produit l'effet inverse ! (Ce n'est pas en nettoyant la peau plusieurs fois par jour que vous allez r\u00e9duire l'acn\u00e9, il faut la nettoyer le matin et le soir - pour ma part uniquement le soir car je n'ai pas une peau tr\u00e8s grasse)\n\nFinalement, ce qui m'a s\u00e9duit dans ce produit c'est de pouvoir trouver tout ce qu'on a besoin pour limiter l'acn\u00e9 sans pour autant devoir acheter plein de produit sans skincare conseill\u00e9. Je n'en pouvais plus d'avoir plusieurs produits et j'ai enfin trouv\u00e9 ce qui me correspondait. Ne nettoyer plus votre peau avec du savon de Marseille en esp\u00e9rant enlever le s\u00e9bum, prenez plut\u00f4t ce savon :)"

Contiene \u00e1cido salic\u00edlico, que ayuda a exfoliar suavemente y a mantener los poros limpios, lo cual es un plus.\n\nLo \u00fanico que me gustar\u00eda mejorar es que los resultados, aunque notables, no son inmediatos y se requiere constancia para ver una reducci\u00f3n significativa de las imperfecciones. Sin embargo, la f\u00f3rmula es lo suficientemente suave para usarlo todos los d\u00edas sin causar irritaci\u00f3n, lo que para m\u00ed es un punto clave.\n\nEn general, es un limpiador muy efectivo, especialmente si tienes piel mixta o grasa y buscas un producto que controle las imperfecciones sin comprometer la hidrataci\u00f3n natural de la piel. \u00a1Muy recomendable!"

Es reinigt die Haut gr\u00fcndlich, ohne sie auszutrocknen \u2013 ein Problem, das ich bei vielen anderen Reinigungsprodukten hatte.

A small quantity of the product is enough so it lasts a really long time. If you have normal or dry skin this product might not be good for you since the salicylic acid is quite strong compared to other acids, like hyaluronic acid."

Die Reinigungslotion enth\u00e4lt drei essenzielle Ceramide (1, 3 und 6-II), die die Hautbarriere unterst\u00fctzen und helfen, Feuchtigkeit zu bewahren. Hyalurons\u00e4ure ist ein weiterer wichtiger Inhaltsstoff, der die Haut hydratisiert und geschmeidig h\u00e4lt. Die nicht-komedogene und parf\u00fcmfreie Formulierung sorgt daf\u00fcr, dass die Poren nicht verstopfen und die Haut nicht irritiert wird.\n\nAnwendung und Ergebnisse:\nDie Anwendung der CeraVe Porentiefe Reinigung ist einfach und angenehm. Ein kleiner Pumpsto\u00df der Lotion reicht aus, um das Gesicht gr\u00fcndlich zu reinigen.

Nach dem Absp\u00fclen f\u00fchlt sich die Haut sauber, erfrischt und nicht gespannt an.\n\nRegelm\u00e4\u00dfige Anwendung der Reinigungslotion f\u00fchrt zu sichtbaren Ergebnissen. Die Haut wirkt klarer und glatter, und das Hautbild insgesamt verbessert sich. Da die Formulierung sanft ist, eignet sie sich auch f\u00fcr die t\u00e4gliche Anwendung, ohne die Haut zu reizen oder auszutrocknen.\n\nVerpackung und Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis:\nDie CeraVe Porentiefe Reinigung kommt in einer praktischen Pumpflasche, die eine hygienische und einfache Dosierung erm\u00f6glicht. Das Produkt ist in verschiedenen Gr\u00f6\u00dfen erh\u00e4ltlich, was es flexibel f\u00fcr unterschiedliche Bed\u00fcrfnisse macht. In Bezug auf das Preis-Leistungs-Verh\u00e4ltnis bietet diese Reinigungslotion eine hervorragende Qualit\u00e4t zu einem vern\u00fcnftigen Preis, besonders angesichts der hochwertigen Inhaltsstoffe und der positiven Ergebnisse.\n\nFazit:\nDie CeraVe Porentiefe Reinigung f\u00fcr das Gesicht ist eine ausgezeichnete Wahl f\u00fcr alle, die eine effektive und sanfte Reinigungsmethode suchen. Mit ihrer durchdachten Formulierung, den pflegenden Inhaltsstoffen und der benutzerfreundlichen Verpackung \u00fcberzeugt sie auf ganzer Linie.

I don\u2019t need to use this product everyday, just every other day, it\u2019s foamy and does a great deep cleanse, has a great natural essential oil smell, leaves my skin bright and clean. You will need a moisturiser after using as with any skin wash routine, I feel like it can be quite drying on the skin and leave the skin feeling tight, but that\u2019s just completely normal. A moisturiser or Vaseline will make up for this. I also pair with a subtle toner by the same brand, I won\u2019t be buying anything else from now on, it\u2019s long lasting, clear light gel, easy pump to use that gives you little at a time, great smell and works perfect for my skin. Ingredients are a bonus and safe. And the price is absolutely great, some other natural brands can be a bit quite expensive. So it\u2019s always easy to top up when I need to!"

As for scent, there isn't much of one, which is grreat because I don't need to \"perfume\" my face. Rinses off nicely. I still can use my molisturizer and my face doesn't feel \"heavy\". Just one pump, or less, does the job. And I really love that you can use it in the shower - so many of them you must use over the sink. I've already ordered 2 more to have on hand. Also perfect for travel."

I have been using Sukin products for around two years now so I've really given them the test of time. I use three products religiously: the Micellar Cleansing Water, the signature Facial Moisturiser, and this foaming facial cleanser. They are all equally excellent and are the only skincare products I use at all. Throughout my life I have been prone to breakouts and extremely sensitive skin. If I ever try and switch out my skincare and try other products, it immediately breaks out. Sukin is the only brand that my skin has ever responded well to, and my skin has never become 'bored' of it so to speak, it has produced consistently good results for the entire two years I have been using it. This cleanser removes makeup SO well, I just use it in the shower and scrub it onto a face full of makeup and it removes EVERYTHING, including stubborn mascara and eyeliner - just make sure you rub it in and make it nice and foamy. It is honestly amazing and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and healthy. I would recommend all Sukin products always."

Initially, I enjoyed using it daily, appreciating its ability to effectively remove dirt and impurities without drying out my skin as much as some cleansers do.\n\nHowever, only a day after my first use I noticed a minor reaction of flakiness around my eyes and nose. This was most likely from one of the ingredients as this has happened to me before. This may only be a rare issue but if you have sensitive skin I recommend patch testing it a day before use.\n\nDespite this reaction, I recognize that skincare products can vary in their effects from person to person. While the Sukin Foaming Facial Cleanser may not have been suitable for my skin, it still offers effective cleansing properties and natural ingredients that may benefit others."

The smell isn't great. When I opened the bottle and took the pump out, it did smell like lemon meringue as another reviewer had stated. But when, actually pumped out and added to water, the smell changes for some bizarre reason and isn't great. It was more expensive than other brands for the same amount, so not economical. I bought this as my usual brand is unavailable, so I thought I would give this a try as it stated is was a FOAM cleanser. The description is very misleading. A foam cleanser should be foam as it is pumped out of the bottle. This is just a liquid soap. The manufacturer should take note that for it to be a foam cleanser, you need a foaming pump to convert the liquid into foam. The pump provided is not the correct pump for converting the liquid into a foam. Sort it out. I would not recommend this, due to the false advertising of the product."

The choice I have to make in a couple of weeks is whether to re-buy this brand or go back to another of my other favourites with virtually no scent."

So after doing much research and reading tons of reviews, I found this facewash that actually works well. It cleans my skin without drying it, and doesn't sting or hurt. It's unscented and doesn't foam, which I like. It's just a clear calming gel. Also, a little goes a long way. I've been using it for months and it's still gonna last for over a year, so it's well worth the price. I did wait for it to go on sale before I bought it, so I'm pleased with my purchase. Also like that it has a pump, but you need to pump it carefully without too much pressure. Otherwise, a lot squirts out."

My usual go to face wash is Nivea for combination skin with ph balancing properties and it has worked as required on my skin for years meaning, does not leave skin too greasy in Summers and doesn't leave skin too dry in winter months. The positives for Thayer's is that a tiny bit goes a long way and is unscented. This bottle would easily last me longer than 3 months. Overall it's good."

It doesn't clog my pores but it also doesn't strip my face. I don't use it on my eyelids because it has a small amount of salicylic acid, but I use it on my whole face. It has no scent and foams up easily. A little goes a long way. I am over 50, and this has been great to find for my combination skin, which is slightly oily in places and quite dry in others. I do follow up with a moisturizer. (For my eye cleanser, I use We Love Eyes Tea Tree Eyelid and Eyelash cleanser. )"

I have sensitive mature skin but happy to note there's been no adverse effects so far. I've noticed my face feels tighter, cleaner, smoother. I'm hoping to see some dark spots clearing up too, further down the track. Thank you for a great quality and reasonably-priced product."

Had tried a few foaming cleaners from stores that ended up either too creamy, not enough froth or sud, broke put skin, etc. Decided to try this based on reviews. It foams up nicely. Only small amount of product needed so should last a long time (I recommend gently squeezing out only a small pee size. This product cleaned my face well. Cleared up much of the breakouts from all the other products I tried. Rinsed well. Has a scent but not overpowering & did not bother my skin. I use this sometimes alone & sometimes with a buffing face pad/or wash cloth for exfoliation. It cleaned my pores without overdrying my skin. My only regret is that I did not try this years ago when it 1st came out. I will definitely continue to use this product. Oh, and the tube is huge! For reference, I'm grandma age but this also works well for the young adults as well. Probably would e good for a teen with acne too as it cleans well without stripping & overdrying skin which in turn if that happens, skin produces more oil to make up for it. Try it. What do you have to lose."

I have probably used over 40 kinds. I will now buy this for the rest of my life. It smells amazing. Nothing overpowering, but subtle and relaxing (not sure a scent can be relaxing, yet here we are). My face is cleansed and so darn soft when I finish. I don\u2019t even understand how it can foam up so thickly and pillowy on my face. It is literally an experience. I\u2019m almost embarrassed by how much it brings me joy. Try it out or not, but I LOVE IT."

This face wash provides a deep and thorough cleanse, removing dirt, oil, and impurities from my skin while still being gentle and non-irritating. One of the things I appreciate the most is how it helps reduce the appearance of pores, giving my skin a smoother and more refined look.\nAdditionally, this cleanser is highly hydrating and moisturizing, ensuring that my skin feels soft and nourished after each wash. Unlike many other cleansers that can leave the skin feeling tight or dry, this one maintains the perfect balance of cleansing and hydration. It is mild and suitable for daily use, making it an excellent choice for anyone who wants a cleanser that is both effective and gentle.\nI have always loved rice-based skincare products, as they work exceptionally well for my skin type and consistently deliver amazing results. This cleanser is no exception! It comes in a generously sized pack that lasts for months, making it cost-effective and worth every penny. I use it twice a day, every single day, and my skin has been benefiting greatly from it.\nOverall, I am extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend it to my friends and family. If you're looking for a cleanser that cleans deeply, minimizes pores, hydrates well, and lasts long, this is worth trying!"

The formula is super gentle on the skin and has a soothing, non-irritating feel, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. It effectively removes dirt and impurities without leaving my face feeling dry or stripped.\n\nThe texture is smooth and easy to apply, and it has a mild, pleasant scent. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while. My skin feels really soft and hydrated after use.\n\nThe only reason I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that it doesn't lather as much as other cleansers I\u2019ve used, which might be a drawback for those who prefer a foamy wash. That said, it\u2019s still a great product and has worked well for me overall. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a gentle, hydrating cleanser!"

Other than the product container which is plastic, there is no other plastic used at all in the packaging which is fantastic\n\nCons:\n- Slightly expensive but worth it. Else, I would say no cons so far\n\nPoints to note:\n- It doesn\u2019t form any lather\n- It doesn\u2019t have any fragrance\n\nOverall experience:\nDefinitely recommend this product to those with dry/sensitive skin and those looking for a product with minimal chemicals. To my dry skin, it has given a decent all-weather face wash option. I hope they come up with a larger bottle as well\n\nTips for other buyers:\nAs it doesn't form any lather, it will get some time to get used to it and to know how much quantity to use.\n\nIf you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up! \ud83d\udc4d\n\n\u092e\u093f\u0928\u093f\u092e\u0932\u093f\u0938\u094d\u091f \u0913\u091f

Upon opening my Amazon package, I found that half of my cleanser had spilled into the box, making it soggy and also obviously wasting half of the product. The product itself is lovely. I have combination skin that leans dry, so I need a cleanser that is thorough but doesn\u2019t dry out. So far after my first two uses, this seems to be it. My skin feels clean but I don\u2019t have that tightness or dryness that I do with harsher cleansers. I don\u2019t feel like I need to run for moisturizer immediately after and I can\u2019t see my pores as prominently. That being said, my only customer service option was to return the defective item to Amazon. For $7.99, this seems excessive to me and quite frankly more trouble (for myself and the environment) than just taking the L. So product gets 5/5 so far, Amazon third-party seller customer service gets 0/5 stars."

I feel like too much of it slips through my fingers and is wasted. It's not so easy to distribute over my face. Maybe it would work with one of those silicone scrubbers? I will use what I have, but will keep looking for something that is a bit creamier or lathers a tiny bit to make it easier to apply."

I chose it because it was cheaper than Korean ones and doctor vanita rattan approved it. My skin started flaking right after one use and my hand palms got extremely dry from just washing my face. It does not feel nice for skin at all. Also the bottle is very cheap quality. It spilled inside the sealed box. Never buying again."

I\u2019ve used previous 2% salicylic acid products before, particularly Image Skin but the price of that is \u00a340 a bottle so I chose this based on good reviews and a cheaper price. Well it\u2019s true, you get what you pay for. I\u2019ve returned this for a refund and am having to repair my skin barrier."

The great thing is it exfoliates my skin and leaves my skin soft and shiny. I don't need to do exfoliation because of this face wash. I use this face wash twice daily and each bottle lasts three to four months. Don't think about anything. If you suffer from bad acne mainly cystic acne it will work great for you."

Unlike other face washes that leave my skin feeling tight or dry, this one locks in hydration, leaving my skin soft, smooth, and refreshed.\n\nThe texture is creamy but lightweight, and it lathers just enough to remove dirt, oil, and makeup without stripping my skin. After each use, my face feels clean, balanced, and healthy, with no dryness or irritation. It\u2019s perfect for anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleanser that supports skin hydration.\n\nIf you need a nourishing face wash that truly cleans without drying your skin, I highly recommend this one!"

That doesn't mean the product is old. This large tube will last me forever. It does leave your skin a little dry but I like that. I have sensitive, acne prone skin so face cleansers with moisturizers don't do the job. I feel like they never really clean just clog pores. I bought the cream to offset the slight dryness. So glad to have gound this gem on Amazon."

No redness, no irritation\u2014just a clean, refreshed canvas. If you're in the sensitive skin squad, give this face wash a whirl; it's the gentle giant your skin deserves!"

Thought it may have only been for the first time using it out but no, second time was just as frustrating. I am in my 30s and have no injuries or issues with my hands.

Normally, I'm a big fan of Korean skincare as it suits my skin better, but this Paula's Choice BHA exfoliator probably beats any other exfoliator I've used.\nWithin 1 week of using this, the blackheads and whiteheads on my nose? GONE! It doesn't even sting your skin like many other acid based exfoliators I've used.\nI've even tried this where my skin was uneven. Guess what happened? My skin became as smooth as a baby's bottom!\nI bought the travel size, which is a bit small (size of my palm). However, you only need one drop a day for results, which is how this tiny bottle lasted me 6 months (and counting!) with half the bottle left.\nThe design of the bottle is also secure, with a little flip top inside the white screw top (which is very good for travelling in my experience).\nTo add, I'm a big fan of making my skincare desk aesthetic, and the minimalistic design of this bottle just tops off how good this exfoliator is. Paula's Choice you've done it again!\n\nPros:\n- Smooths skin\n- Doesn't sting AT ALL\n- Gets rid of blackheads / whiteheads\n- Secure flip top\n- Aesthetic bottle\n\nCons:\n- NONE!"

I\u2019ve found through trial and error that my skin responds much better to BHA\u2019s than AHA\u2019s. The latter are too harsh and strip my skin which is very sensitive and dry. I\u2019ve even been using this product almost every night on my chin, which is much more frequently than I usually use exfoliants but somehow it\u2019s gentle enough not to have me peeling or red and sensitive. Having said that, I don\u2019t think I need to use it this often I\u2019m just overexcited about the results.\nI had other paula\u2019s choice products, one with BHA in it and I even used the BHA 9 product for a while but they weren\u2019t nearly as effective as this formula.\nI will repurchase this and I\u2019m so glad I found it after reading reviews!"

But after just two applications my skin has gotten brighter, clearer, and none of my pores are visible anymore. It is quite strong so you shouldn't use it every day, I use it twice a week.

I don\u2019t believe that this can prevent acne (thanks to my hormones for that) but it does a fantastic job of managing it. The instructions are to use it up to twice daily, but I found this dried out my skin (which is weird cuz I\u2019m so oily). Instead I use it every two days, and I use my benzoyl peroxide treatment on every other day. With a niacinamide serum this just works so well. The only downside is that it smells a bit weird, like vinegar. Nevertheless I am recommending it to anyone who will listen to me!

My skin was quite good other than the pigmentation, but after one use it is noticeable how much smaller my pores look and fine lines have improved. I was amazed at how much it improved my skin quality.\n\nI try to care for my skin and cleanse and moisturise morning and night and use sunscreen, and after one use, I\u2019m thinking this might be the product I ensure I never run out of. No idea if it will work on the pigmentation but I would be surprised if it didn\u2019t.\n\nIt is quite runny but easy to apply with fingers. Smells a little sour but after applying moisturiser, I can\u2019t smell it anymore. Worth the cost."

I recently discovered this brand, and I\u2019m impressed by the high quality and effectiveness of their products, especially at this price point. This face wash is no exception!\n\nI use it in the shower, working the gel into a light foam on my face. The results are immediately noticeable\u2014after using it, my skin feels tighter and thoroughly clean. The gel texture is pleasant to apply, spreading easily without creating an overwhelming amount of foam or requiring heavy lathering for good coverage.\n\nPaired with a good moisturizer, this face wash truly delivers. Within the first week, I\u2019ve noticed clearer pores and an improvement in the appearance of my forehead lines. I\u2019ll definitely be repurchasing this face wash!"

I couldn't believe my eyes, unlike most face wash that will just wash your face and leave the make-up, la roche-posay mela B3 took off everything, even my eye make-up! My skin wasn't irritated or stressed. I was so impressed! It contains melasyl and niacinamide so it also takes reduces hyperpigmentation and reduces those awful dark spots on the face leaving your skin soft and baby like. I totally recommend this product, too bad i didn't find it to buy again on amazon."

For optimal results, I recommend applying it after cleansing and toning your skin. Start with a pea-sized amount and gently massage it into your face and neck, allowing it to absorb fully before applying your moisturizer or sunscreen.\n\nFor best results, use it both morning and night. Consistency is key, so incorporating it into your daily routine will help you see improvements over time. It\u2019s also essential to use sunscreen during the day, as the ingredients in this gel can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure.\n\nI've noticed a significant difference in my skin\u2019s clarity and brightness since I started using this gel. It absorbs quickly and doesn\u2019t leave any sticky residue, which is a huge plus. Overall, I highly recommend the La Roche-Posay Mela B3 Gel for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine!"

I can tell it is definitely doing something, and if it is like all of their other products I will be glad I used it after a while, but it has only been a week or so. It is a smaller amount than I was used to getting from this company, and has a sorta chemical smell to it, which is not like all of their other products. It looks clear and like the original face wash from the light blue bottle, just not as much. I suppose you shouldn\u2019t use as much."

The face wash comes out in a cream form which at first appears similar to some other known brands. The main difference, however, comes through once applied to the face at instantly turns into a highly foamy, exfoliating and soothing face wash. Best of all, the creamy texture followed by bubbles feel wondrously hydrating on the skin. As a sensitive skin sufferer, with combination skin, this face wash truly feels just right. It cleanses without stripping too deeply, thus leaving my face feeling supple, especially when using with their face cream.\n\nIt's been two months of use for me and my skin honestly have not felt more gentle and spot free. I'll admit when it comes to pigments and acne scars, this face wash misses the needed salicylic acid to tackle blemishes. On the other hand, for long-term use, this face wash becomes the best option to achieving clean, balanced skin."

The ingredients can be seen on the packaging to this extent as well as a brilliant breakdown on cidecoder. Most of us with acne issues on prescribed creams and gels including benzoyl peroxide need to be extremely careful of what we add to our skin. Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide do not mix well and completely strip the skin of its natural moisture barrier when used together... Which can lead to more problematic breakouts and irritation, hence why we opt for products known to help with dry and dehydrated skin.\nHylarounic acid isn't listed in the ingredients for this cleanser, instead its sodium hydroxide which is a cousin to hylarounic acid. Kind of a misleading cleanser experience but you live and learn I guess....! Should definitely state more clearly it includes Salicylic-Acid though. Wouldn't recommend for those of us needing a gentle and or hydrating cleanser and on benzoyl or other drying agents."

Eventually, I chose this one. My skin type is combination, menopausal and sometimes sensitive. I've been suffering for quite some time with awful regular breakouts which have an effect on my confidence. I've tried so many face washes from expensive to cheap but this one has become my absolute favourite. I can't smell any scent to it (which is good) and it has a creamy consistency that lathers up really quickly. After using this my skin feels clean and fresh and doesn't suffer from that horrible tight feeling you sometimes get after washing your face. Also, my multiple spot breakout has practically all but gone in just a matter of days! A first for me. I love it! I'll definitely be buying it again."

Als jemand, der unter trockener Haut leidet und nach einer sanften Reinigung sucht, bin ich von diesem Produkt begeistert und m\u00f6chte meine positive Erfahrung teilen.\n\nDer erste Eindruck von diesem Reinigungs\u00f6l ist \u00e4u\u00dferst positiv. Die leichte Textur f\u00fchlt sich sanft auf der Haut an und hinterl\u00e4sst ein angenehmes, nicht fettiges Gef\u00fchl. Die Formulierung ist mit essenziellen Ceramiden angereichert, die dazu beitragen, die nat\u00fcrliche Schutzbarriere der Haut zu st\u00e4rken und Feuchtigkeit einzuschlie\u00dfen.\n\nDie Wirksamkeit dieses Reinigungs\u00f6ls ist beeindruckend. Es entfernt sanft und gr\u00fcndlich Schmutz, Make-up und \u00fcbersch\u00fcssiges \u00d6l von meiner Haut, ohne sie auszutrocknen oder zu reizen. Selbst wasserfestes Make-up wird m\u00fchelos entfernt, w\u00e4hrend die Haut gleichzeitig mit Feuchtigkeit versorgt wird.\n\nDie Vielseitigkeit dieses Reinigungs\u00f6ls ist ebenfalls bemerkenswert. Es eignet sich f\u00fcr alle Hauttypen, von normaler bis sehr trockener Haut, und kann m\u00fchelos in meine bestehende Hautpflegeroutine integriert werden. Ich verwende es gerne als ersten Schritt meiner Doppelreinigung, um meine Haut gr\u00fcndlich zu reinigen und gleichzeitig zu pflegen.\n\nDie Vertr\u00e4glichkeit dieses Reinigungs\u00f6ls ist ein weiterer Pluspunkt. Es ist frei von Duftstoffen und Parabenen und wurde von Dermatologen entwickelt, was es besonders schonend und vertr\u00e4glich f\u00fcr empfindliche Haut macht. Das gibt mir das Vertrauen, dass ich ein sicheres und wirksames Produkt verwende, das meiner Haut guttut.\n\nAlles in allem kann ich das CeraVe Feuchtigkeitsspendende Reinigungs\u00f6l jedem empfehlen, der nach einer sanften und wirksamen Reinigung f\u00fcr seine Haut sucht. Mit seiner hochwertigen Formulierung, sanften Wirkung und Vertr\u00e4glichkeit ist es eine ideale Wahl f\u00fcr alle, die eine gesunde und strahlende Haut anstreben."

Es besitzt eine angenehme Textur und l\u00e4sst sich leicht auf der Haut verteilen und einmassieren.\n\n\u2013 Feuchtigkeitsversorgung: Das Produkt spendet Feuchtigkeit. Ich habe in der Vergangenheit verschiedene Reiniger ausprobiert und hatte stets mit einem Spannungsgef\u00fchl der Haut zu k\u00e4mpfen. Dieses Problem trat mit diesem Produkt nicht auf und die Haut f\u00fchlt sich danach gut an.\n\n\u2013 Vertr\u00e4glichkeit: Meine Haut hat keine negativen Reaktionen auf das Produkt gezeigt.\n\nDas Reinigungs\u00f6l hinterl\u00e4sst au\u00dferdem keinen \u00d6lfilm nach dem Abwaschen, allerdings dauert das Abwaschen etwas l\u00e4nger als bei anderen Produkten. Gr\u00fcndliches Abwaschen ist wichtig \u2013 andernfalls k\u00f6nnten die nachfolgenden Produkte beim Auftragen auf die Haut sch\u00e4umen oder schmieren.\n\nFolgendes ist f\u00fcr mich neutral und von nicht gro\u00dfer Bedeutung:\n\n\u2013 Geruch: Ich bin kein gro\u00dfer Fan davon, aber bei einem Reiniger ist das auch nicht ausschlaggebend. Der Geruch ist zudem nicht besonders stark wahrzunehmen.\n\nAu\u00dferdem kam der Reiniger diesmal auf Englisch und nicht Deutsch an. Das scheint bei den CeraVe-Produkten eine Gl\u00fcckssache zu sein.\n\nIch habe das Produkt bereits zweimal bestellt und w\u00fcrde es in Zukunft auch weiterhin bestellen. Da das Reinigungs\u00f6l das macht was es soll, gebe ich f\u00fcnf Sterne und kann es weiterempfehlen.\n\nStand: 20.11.2023"

I take good care of my skin and only want to use the best non irritating products and this is up there with the best.\nI start off using the Easy Peasy Oil Cleanser (purchased on Amazon) followed by CeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser for Normal to Very Dry Skin prior to applying my skincare products every evening. This cleanser is non drying and none irritating.\nPlease note that the cleanser does not come out of the pump container as a 'foam', the liquid becomes a foam after a small amount of water is added which is great as it is more controllable and less messy. The consistency of the liquid is thick which again makes it much easier to control and the fact that it has a pump is another plus. I personally only use this once per day as I do not find it necessary to use any cleanser in my morning routine.\nHighly Recommend\nPRO'S:\nPump container giving easy controlled access\nOnly small amount required for whole face and neck\nLarge size\nValue for money\nGentle does not irritate skin so ideal for dry or sensitive skin\nAddition of Ceramides and Squalane\nCons:\nNone so far"

Dies macht es zu einer guten Option f\u00fcr Menschen mit empfindlicher oder zu Allergien neigender Haut.\n\nAllerdings ist der Duft, obwohl er nat\u00fcrlich und nicht aufdringlich ist, nicht mein Favorit. Ich h\u00e4tte mir gew\u00fcnscht, dass es duftneutral w\u00e4re oder einen angenehmeren nat\u00fcrlichen Duft h\u00e4tte.\n\nAu\u00dferdem finde ich, dass die Flasche etwas gro\u00df und sperrig ist, was die Handhabung erschwert. Eine kleinere, kompaktere Verpackung w\u00e4re w\u00fcnschenswert, vor allem f\u00fcr Reisen.\n\nTrotz dieser kleinen M\u00e4ngel ist das CeraVe Feuchtigkeitsspendende Reinigungs\u00f6l ein hochwertiges Produkt, das ich definitiv weiterempfehlen kann. Es bietet eine sanfte, aber gr\u00fcndliche Reinigung und pflegt die Haut, w\u00e4hrend es reinigt."

Io mi inumidisco il volto e metto due pump di prodotto tra le mani sfrizionandolo, chiudo gli occhi e lo passo ovunque, insistendo sulla zona occhi dove ho il mascara. Sempre a occhi chiuso apro il rubinetto e rimuovo il prodotto, poi li riapro e con un panno in microfibra rimuovo eventuali residui di makeup. La pelle risulta dopo pulitissima ed effetto rimpolpato quasi, per nulla secca. Dopo mi passo siero e crema viso. \u00c8 un prodotto valido per ogni tipologia di pelle, grassa o secca. Sono molto contenta dell'acquisto. Ho sempre usato erborian, ma l'olio oleoso costa 27 euro e il detergente 27 euro, qua con 12 euro faccio tutto!"

No need for multiple cleansing. Finish off washing your face quickly and simple with this product.\nOIL TYPE CENTELLA EXTRACT: To put Centella Asiatica into oil, we used MCT oil, which consists merely 7% of coconut, as a solvent and succeeded in extracting oil type Centella Asiatica. Unlike other liquid type of it, you can experience deep and pure nature of it.\nSAFE AND OPTIMAL FORMULA: Instead of harmful and irritating ingredients, we put only mild and safe ingredients including plant derived oils. It\u2019s a hypoallergenic oil that won\u2019t cause any soar eyes or thick oil layers while using it.\nFRESH AND LIGHT TEXTURE: Light and thin oil cleanse deep inside pores and provides fresh feelings after washing. It\u2019d be a great starter for people who haven\u2019t used oil for cleansing their face.\nMICELLAR CLEANSING: We\u2019ve come up with our own micellar method to provide unique cleansing oil. It\u2019s a transparent water type at the beginning, but it goes milky as soon as it meets water. This allows thorough cleansing and moist finish."

                "review": "As a facial plastic surgeon, I'm constantly seeking out high-quality skincare products that can benefit both my patients and myself. With the rising popularity of K-beauty products, I couldn't resist trying the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil. After using this product consistently for several weeks, both morning and night, I feel confident in sharing my thoughts.\n\nI have incredibly sensitive and oily skin, which is prone to breakouts and underlying rosacea. Finding a cleanser that doesn't irritate my skin or exacerbate these issues can be a challenge. However, I'm pleased to report that the SKIN1004 cleansing oil works exceptionally well for my sensitive skin. Throughout my use, I have not experienced any irritation or increase in breakouts.\n\nOne aspect of this cleansing oil that I appreciate is its light scent. Many individuals with sensitive skin, myself included, can be easily irritated by strong fragrances. The SKIN1004 cleansing oil has a very subtle, pleasant scent that doesn't overwhelm or cause any discomfort.\n\nIt's important to note that proper application and removal techniques are crucial when using an oil cleanser, as improper use can lead to breakouts. To use this product effectively, begin by applying the oil to dry skin and massaging it well. This allows the oil to break down makeup, sunscreen, and other impurities. Next, wet your hands and massage your face again, creating a light emulsion. This step is essential for ensuring that the oil is fully emulsified and can be easily rinsed off without leaving any residue behind. Finally, rinse the product off your face thoroughly with water. I believe that many people experience breakouts with oil cleansers due to improper application or removal techniques, which can leave an oily residue on the skin.\n\nI highly recommend the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil for anyone looking for a gentle and effective K-beauty cleanser, particularly those with sensitive or oily skin. By following the proper application and removal techniques, you can enjoy the benefits of this cleanser without the risk of breakouts or irritation. The light scent and high-quality ingredients make this product a valuable addition to any skincare routine."

Adem\u00e1s, el producto tiene un aroma suave y natural, lo que lo hace a\u00fan m\u00e1s agradable de usar. La presentaci\u00f3n de 200 ml es perfecta, ya que un poco de producto es suficiente para cada limpieza, por lo que dura bastante. Si buscas un limpiador efectivo y suave que respete tu barrera cut\u00e1nea, el Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil es una excelente opci\u00f3n. \u00a1Lo recomiendo mucho!"

                "review": "Ich habe durch diverse Trends oft schon gelesen, dass eine \u00f6lhaltige Reinigung auch gegen verstopfte und gro\u00dfe Poren helfen kann. Wirklich geglaubt habe ich das nie. Bis jetzt.\n\nMeine Haut ist gemischt, viele gl\u00e4nzende Stellen aber auch trockene Bereiche. Mir wurde daher das Reinigungs\u00f6l und der Schaumreiniger empfohlen. Ich habe beides bestellt und direkt probiert.\n\nDer Duft war im ersten Moment nicht das, was ich erwartet hatte - tats\u00e4chlich dachte ich im ersten Moment an Sellerie. Keine Ahnung warum, denn der Duft ist ganz leicht und sehr fein. Nach der Anwendung war das dann auch weg und seither riecht es angenehm dezent in Richtung Bergamotte.\n\nAnwendung und Handhabung sind einfach, die ben\u00f6tigte Menge ist zudem gering da beides sehr ergiebig ist. Meine Haut hat etwas gebraucht um sich umzustellen, da sie anfangs noch viel \"Fett\" nachproduziert hat, was aber mit regelm\u00e4\u00dfiger Anwendung verschwunden ist. Meine Haut wirkt allgemein heller, sauberer und ich habe immer ein gutes Gef\u00fchl danach. Ich kann die Produkte nur empfehlen!\n\nGro\u00dfer Pluspunkt f\u00fcr mich war die tierversuchsfreie Entwicklung! Da diverse St\u00e4dte erst k\u00fcrzlich riesige Versuchslabore gebaut haben (z.B. Augsburg mit \u00fcber 250.000 Tieren!!), lege ich darauf nun absolut Wert!"

Not only does it leave our skin feeling clean and refreshed, but it also effectively removes makeup and impurities without any greasy residue.\n\nThe hypoallergenic formula is perfect for our sensitive skin. We've experienced no irritation or breakouts, which is fantastic. The Centella Asiatica soothes and hydrates our skin, leaving it soft and nourished.\n\nOne thing that surprised us was how well it works on removing build-up like white and blackheads, especially on my husband's nose. He actually uses it more than I do now because of this!\n\nThe light texture and refreshing micellar cleansing effect are also great. The 6.76 fl. oz (200ml) size is generous and will last a long time. Overall, we highly recommend this cleansing oil to anyone looking for a gentle, effective, and soothing cleanser for the whole family!\n\nPros:\n- Gentle and effective\n- Hypoallergenic\n- Removes build-up like white/blackheads\n- Leaves skin soft and hydrated\n- No greasy residue\n\nCons:\n- None so far"

My pores are not completely gone yet, but I can tell they are gradually improving with continued use. What I really love is how soft and smooth my skin feels after each wash. It also gives my face a nice, healthy glow without feeling greasy. The only reason I\u2019m giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I wish the pore-minimizing effect was a bit faster, but overall, I\u2019m happy with this product and will keep using it!"

I love the natural floral/tea-like scent, it\u2019s like a spa in a bottle! I frequently use this as my only cleanser on days when I haven\u2019t sweat much, worn makeup, or put on sunscreen and it causes no irritation or dryness. It washes completely clean so I don\u2019t feel like I have to follow it up with a traditional cleanser like I do with other balms and oils I\u2019ve tried. I\u2019m using so much less of this than I did with other balms and oils, so it\u2019s ended up being way more cost effective even though the price of the bottle is higher than my previous products."

There is nothing exceptional that I felt using this product for the last 2 months but it works and gets the job done without causing damage to my skin's barrier or breaking me out (I have combo acne prone skin). The only thing that I hated at first was the fragrance which feels really strong the first couple uses, but then you kinda get used to it. I think I will try other oil cleansers before settling down on this one."

I do not feel the need to use a makeup wipe to remove my makeup. Tough things like mascara also just melt off and the impressive part is that I was able to use it near my eyes without any irritation. I can really feel it sucking out all the dirt and gunk out of my face and it emulsifies really well with just a couple drops of water. If you have sensitive skin this product is worth a shot since it's very calming."

This product has truly transformed my skincare routine for the better.\n\nGentle Yet Effective: This cleansing oil is incredibly gentle on my skin while effectively removing makeup, sunscreen, and impurities. I love how it breaks down even the most stubborn makeup without any harsh rubbing. It leaves my skin feeling clean and refreshed without any greasy residue.\n\nLightweight Texture: The texture is lightweight and silky, making it a pleasure to apply. It glides effortlessly over the skin, providing a luxurious cleansing experience. I appreciate that it rinses off easily with water, leaving no oily film behind.\n\nSkin-Loving Ingredients: The centella asiatica extract is a standout ingredient in this cleanser. It soothes my skin and helps reduce any redness or irritation, which is a significant plus for my sensitive skin. I\u2019ve noticed an improvement in my skin\u2019s overall texture since I started using it.\n\nGreat for Daily Use: I use this cleanser daily, and it has become an essential part of my evening skincare routine. It prepares my skin perfectly for the next steps in my regimen, ensuring that my serums and moisturizers absorb more effectively.\n\nFinal Thoughts: I highly recommend the SKIN1004 Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil Cleanser to anyone looking for a gentle yet effective cleansing solution. It\u2019s affordable, high-quality, and has made a noticeable difference in my skin\u2019s health. This cleanser has earned a permanent place in my skincare lineup!"

But even after a year of accutane, my acne came back within a matter of months. THIS PRODUCT cured my recurring acne. I used to have huge cystic acne all over my chest, back and face, especially around the time of my period but within less than 2 months of using this product, my body acne has completely disappeared and my facial acne has been reduced to tiny bumps that only show up around my period. Make sure to moisturise your skin immediately after using it though coz it tends to dry it out a little. But honestly, I'm probably gonna use this for the rest of my life. And if i could, I\u2019d probably give it 6/5 stars\ud83e\udd29"

Nichts hat so viel gebracht wie dieses Duschgel.\n\nIch benutze es zusammen mit einem afrikanischen Waschschwamm, was das Produkt richtig gut aufsch\u00e4umen l\u00e4sst. Mit nur einem Pumpsto\u00df decke ich den ganzen K\u00f6rper ab, sodass das Duschgel wahrscheinlich ewig h\u00e4lt \u2013 der Preis ist also mehr als gerechtfertigt.\n\nZus\u00e4tzlich empfehle ich, nach dem Duschen den Toner von The Ordinary zu verwenden. Ich habe ihn in eine Spr\u00fchflasche umgef\u00fcllt und spr\u00fche ihn auf meinen R\u00fccken und mein Dekollet\u00e9. Seit ich diese Routine befolge, habe ich keine aktiven Pickel mehr, und die roten Stellen werden immer blasser.\n\nEines kann ich sagen: Durchhalten, es wird besser!"

Not only does it truly work for sensitive skin (I've had eczema from skincare products and stress, and I struggle with keratosis pilaris, so I'm really that sensitive), it cleared up my acne and KP on my back and arms in less than 30 days. It's a chemical peel, so daily use isn't really encouraged, but I've used it up to 3-4x a week with no reaction. It leaves my skin feeling feather soft, and any acne/KP that does pop up is smaller and easier to exfoliate with a body scrubber. My bacne has been a bane to my existence since I went through hormonal changes (yay menopause!), but this finally cleared it up with the same results I had with FAB KP Bump Eraser, but for less money, more product, and without the need for pumice. Amazing! The only thing I'm not smitten with is the smell, but it's tea tree oil, so the heady mint smell wasn't a surprise to me and worth it if clears up my skin."

I use it with an exfoliating rag and I feel squeaky clean.\n\nOne thing that I did notice is that it lathers well and it helped with my hyperpigmentation. I noticed after almost finishing the bottle, the skin on my neck was peeling! So just a caution to how often you use it.\n\nI pair it with this other kojic bodywash which really helps to even out my complexion. With continued use, I would expect to see results in two to three weeks.\n\nTip: This body wash is good at cleaning and removing grime/sweat but might be a bit drying on the skin for some due to the cosmetic acids AHA, BHA, and PHA. If you find that it dries your skin, follow up with a moisturizing body wash such as Dove Bar or Shea Moisture Soap Bar."

I didn\u2019t see a immediate difference you can feel it which is the softness but as for as acne goes I have had less ingrown and breakouts, but do actively still get them of course a I have a hormone problems so I\u2019m still going to be getting breakouts, but using this product it wasn\u2019t as bad as before. I sometimes use it on my face not to much and harsh because it gives a tingle sensation like you just brushed your teeth. I also you this with a African net sponge , with a amlatin lotion and medline remedy antifungal cream lotion for my under bust (which helps with under bust sweat breakout and discoloration for my ladies) and it works wonders."

From the first use, I was impressed by how soothing it felt on my skin.\n\nThis lotion has a lightweight, milky texture that glides on effortlessly. It gently removes impurities without any harsh rubbing, leaving my skin feeling clean, soft, and comfortable. There\u2019s no tightness or dryness afterward, just a fresh, hydrated feeling.\n\nWhat really sets this cleanser apart is its minimalist formula. It\u2019s free from potential irritants like fragrances and preservatives, which is perfect for my reactive skin. While it being also non-rinse is a bonus, especially when my skin is feeling extra sensitive. I'm newer to using cleanser that are so, which is the reason behind my review being four stars instead of five.\n\nThis cleanser has earned a spot in my routine. If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin, I highly recommend giving this a try\u2014it\u2019s a true skincare staple."

About 8 weeks post procedure I went back to my Cerave foaming facial cleanser and my face broke out. I went back to the Tolerance and my face quit breaking out so Ive continued to use it and my face looks great. This product is a facial milk. I use it twice a day. It will not remove makeup very well so I switch to a foaming cleanser on days i wear makeup which is not very often. This is now my go-to for every day cleansing."

I thought I would try this because it's cheaper than the La Roche Posay toleriane gentle cream dermo-cleanser that I find works the best, but also feels a bit gross on my skin - slimy. I also don't like how mucousy this feels on my skin, but indeed it does the job without causing a flare up, whichs surprises me because if I leave it on like I always do with cleansers, it gets a bit stingy. Some cleansers also blow out my pores and this doesn't do that. My skin doesn't dry out, and my toner and moisturiser would also have a part to play in that, but overall I would definitely recommend people with rosacea who are looking for a cost effective cleanser should give this a try.\n\nIf it doesn't work, just give it to someone, if you've got a skin condition, it's not worth forging through the rest of the bottle, trust me, you'll wreck your face."

I have rosacea and this product doesn't trigger it. I got it to wash off the thicker facial sunscreen and I don't wear makeup. One note I need to make is that I wouldn't use it if my skin was dry. This is not hydrating at all."

Instead of the brightening effect it promises, my skin looked dull and flaky. The formula feels harsh and stripped my skin of its natural moisture. I also noticed that it didn\u2019t help with breakouts as I had hoped, and in fact, my skin seemed more sensitive and prone to redness. Overall, it did more harm than good, and I wouldn\u2019t recommend this product to anyone with sensitive or combination skin."

Also, within 1 week of using this, my oily skin became EXTREME ROUGH and DRY. Skin started PEELING OFF, extreme IRRITATION and REDNESS showed up. No moisturizer could heal my dry skin. I immediately stopped using the cleanser but I still do have a few rough patches here and there on my skin. My skin isn't completely healed from the damage caused by the HARSH CHEMICALS of the cleanser.\nPlease DON'T BUY this one if you have oily yet \"sensitive to chemicals\" skin type, like mine. Instead, opt for tons of natural and organic alternatives out there, which provide better results and lesser skin damage.\nI WON'T EVER recommend this product to anyone."

Das Gel von Avene in Kombination mit Teebaum\u00f6l ist der absolute Killer f\u00fcr akute Akne, absolut zu empfehlen und man kommt sehr lange mit aus! Werde ich mir definitiv nachbestellen."

To be honest, I didn't actually realise it was an oil cleanser until I actually put it on my skin and never thought an oil cleanser would be for me but after getting used to the consistency on my skin, I was super impressed. It removed a full face of makeup quite easily and left my skin feeling clean and refreshed.\n\nOver the past three days of use my skin has gotten softer and softer. I also feel that it is allowing my vitamin C serum to penetrate better. Honestly, my skin is baby soft right now and it's hard not to keep touching it!"

                "review": "This is a good sized amount of product. I originally was going to use two pumps of the product but after the first pump. I could tell I wouldn't need much more so I added a half pump more. So 1.5 pumps total, I could have easily only used .5 or 1 pump. It felt so nourishing on my skin. Like most other double cleansing oils,any times it can leave your vision a little \"foggy\" for a moment after using, an annoying but harmless side effect. But to my surprise, I didn't have that experience at all. Every product cleansing oil I've tried has always done that to me. So already it was a plus for me.\nI'm gently on my eye area so I don't hurt my eyelashes or delicate and thin skin in the eye area..I gently press my fingertips onto the eyelids to \"melt\" makeup away. I don't ever use a scrubbing motion. This method worked wonderfully as well this time. The cleansing oil spread easily but was not at all runny, nor was it goopy. It was the perfect consistency. No harsh smells or burning or irritating texture against my skin. Great for sensitive and delicate skin. I rinsed my mascara and eyeshadow of easily after 40 seconds of gentle rubbing. No residue left behind and my skin isn't tight and dry and is so wet to the touch. I don't wear much makeup, usually just eyes or long lasting lip color. But I do live in a humid southern USA state and need to get the sticky humid off at the end of a day. Worked wonders. I could have been fine with using just this but I also bought the foam cleanser well and the combination of both was phenomenal for this skincare nerd. I do believe these will last quite some time so makes it great value for the money. Quality skincare and I'm excited to try more of their products!\nPics show my eye makeup before applying, after with it on my skin, and after only rinsing it three times. I used a roll of gift wrapping tape for scale of bottle size.. came with a nice an easy to remove sanitary safety clasp to prevent spillage."

My sebum production got lower, my pores felt cleaner, and even my pores got smaller! However, I have to admit that I double cleansed. I used Cerave Acne Foaming Cream Cleanser and CeraVe Acne Control Cleanser after Anua Heartleaf Pore Control Cleansing Oil. In my opinion they all worked great. I do want to try Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam as a part of the double cleansing package. I want to see if it can do a better job than the Cerave. All in all, this product really did get down into my pores and made my face cleaner."

After using it, I experienced a dramatic breakout\u2014something I\u2019ve never dealt with before, apart from an occasional pimple. Despite not having sensitive skin, this product left my face in worse condition than ever. I wanted to love this cleanser, but it has completely ruined my skin\u2019s health.\n\nHeartleaf Pore Deep Cleansing Foam:\nThe cleansing foam further worsened my experience. It wrecked my skin barrier, leaving it feeling stripped and vulnerable. Even though my skin is usually resilient and not prone to sensitivity, this product caused dryness and discomfort that I hadn\u2019t experienced with other cleansers.\n\nOverall, I wouldn\u2019t recommend these products, especially for those who value maintaining a healthy skin barrier. While they might work for others, my experience has been nothing short of frustrating and damaging."
