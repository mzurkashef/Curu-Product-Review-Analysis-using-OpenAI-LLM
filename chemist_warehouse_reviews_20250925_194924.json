Not great for removing mascara/eyeliner type makeup and its not advertised to do that, im just adding this here in case anyone was wondering."

I read the reviews and whilst people said it didn't have a great smell, honestly no complaints for the price range and quality of ingredients this product offers. It doesn't necessarily foam in your hands, it'll make small soap suds and massages into the face so well! I love it and I'll be stocking up on more."

It worked just as well - removes eye liner, mascara, foundation, eye shadow and also daily SPF if I'm not wearing make up. My approach to skincare has switched to practical now - what actually works and nourishes the skin. Will keep purchasing this. Price point is wonderful as well."

I have never had an issue before with removing these products using other cleaners - even ones at a third of the price. I respect that it may work for some, but this product is not for me."

I had tried so many different products to help it and some were ok, but in the end, they didn't give me the result I was looking for and the acne even got worse. Then I came across the foaming gel about a month or so ago. I already knew the brand because I had been using the BB cream and was happy with that, so I bought this and thought I'd give it ago - OMG! It has been incredible! It won't get rid of any acne you already have, sooth it and but it will prevent anymore from showing up. Now, my skin has become much clearer, the redness is almost all gone, it's gentle on my sensitive skin and makes my skin feel really soft after use. I'm never using anything else again."

        "review": "A really nice simple cleanser for oily skin. It foams up and gives a nice clean but feels quite soothing and doesn’t make your skin feel dry or tight. I’ve been alternating this with a cleanser containing salicylic acid and my skin is feeling more balanced in terms of oil production with less breakouts. Will definitely buy again."

        "review_date": "week ago",
        "review": "The gel has a lightweight, clear texture that lathers nicely, and I love that it’s fragrance free, which makes it gentle on my sensitive skin. After a few weeks of consistent use, my face feels noticeably cleaner, less oily throughout the day, and I’ve seen fewer breakouts. My skin tone also looks more even, and I appreciate that it doesn’t strip my skin of moisture like other acne targeting cleansers often do. Overall, it’s become a staple in my skincare routine, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone with oily, acne prone, or sensitive skin."

        "review_date": "3 years ago",
        "review": "I am in my mid-forties and I have oily, slightly olive skin, which used to be prone to breakouts, but is now smooth and completely free of wrinkles. I have used up two tubes of this product, which I've purchased both in-store and online. It is an effective formula for sensitive skin. I love the design of the tube, which dispenses the product in modest amounts and in its entirety; when I got towards the end of the tube, I didn't have to cut it open to get any residual product out, it emptied perfectly, and you can see this, as the tube is transparent. Both of these factors, (physical ease of use and transparency of packaging), are holy grails for me as a consumer! Very good product design in terms of packaging. It doesn't sting and my skin is left feeling and looking smooth. As I had considerable pigmentation prior to using it, I noticed more than 50% reduction, I'd say close to 80% reduction in pigmentation, which continues to improve over time. So it exceeds the manufacturer's estimates its effectiveness, in my experience. Another big tick there. I like the fact that in addition to salicylic acid, it also contains zinc PCA, which helps heal and stabilise the skin. It lasts about four months or so with twice daily use. Going back for another tube soon. I highly recommend this product to maintain skin clarity and even out skin tone."

I’m a huge skin care fanatic yet have always struggled with textured skin/closed comedones, black heads, pimples here and there etc. I feel like I’ve tried it all, even gone down the fungal acne route. I just come across this cleanser randomly on a TikTok and thought why not? Even though I love my cetaphil (which I still use). Maybe for some reason I was drawn to it because whilst this brand seems decent, I still viewed it as an expensive hype and I find their products confusing. Take my money though!! This product is actually so cheap for what it is. I swear it has in only just a week made such a difference. My skin feels amazing after I cleanse with this. I use it every night. It’s very refreshing and tingly. Not abrasive, just smooth and sudsy. A little goes a long way. I can’t believe I’m potentially going to have smooth skin! It’s also very even toned and just so clean and clear. It’s added to my holy grail list. I find using it with Paulas Choice aha and toner has been a great combination"

So I thought I'd give this lotion a try as a Step 2 in my cleansing routine, instead of my usual Japanese lotion. Unfortunately I am quite disappointed. I like the gentle smell of it and how it leaves my skin matte after using it, but it doesn't do a good job removing makeup at all. Also it totally destroys the makeup pad in the process. It just starts fraying and falling apart, leaving fibers on my skin, which doesn't happen when I'm using my usual lotion. I regret buying this product and definitely won't buy it again."

I have very dry skin and it's been playing up during my pregnant. I thought this was be too harsh or drying, or that my skin would be too sensitive, but I've loved it so far! I only use it every 2-3 days just in case it's too intense to use daily, but omgosh my skin feels so soft, smooth and clear since using it! I've also gone back to my Nivea soft cream (and OG) which I think has helped. Would definitely recommend this toner, and it smells lovely! Not strong but a subtle smell of rose water."

It's incredibly refreshing, and I love how lightweight it feels on my skin. The zinc sulfate in the formula helps to mattify my complexion and reduce the appearance of pores, especially around my T-zone.What I appreciate most is how it calms any redness or irritation, making it perfect after a workout or a hot day. The fine mist is soothing and absorbs quickly, leaving my skin feeling clean and refreshed. It's also a great base for makeup, helping it stay in place longer. If you're dealing with oily or acne-prone skin, this spray is definitely worth trying."

If you don’t plan to use it with the these other products, you may well like it as it does feel more moisturising but for me, it won’t become a staple in my daily skincare routine."

But after using it for about a month, I’m genuinely impressed! The fragrance is fresh and uplifting, and the price point is excellent for the quality. It delivered on its promises — my skin feels plump, hydrated, and brighter, with no dryness at all. It’s also a fantastic base for makeup: non-greasy, quick to absorb, and works beautifully under foundation. I’ll definitely be repurchasing — it’s earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine."

This serum features a vibrant yellow color and a lightweight, runny consistency that absorbs rapidly into the skin, leaving no sticky or greasy residue behind. One of the standout benefits I've experienced is its remarkable ability to diminish age spots and dark patches, resulting in a noticeably brighter and more even complexion. My skin feels significantly smoother and radiates a healthy glow. Additionally, the serum layers beautifully under moisturizers, making it a breeze to incorporate into my daily skincare routine. I also appreciate its delightful fragrance; unlike many other serums that tend to be odorless, this one has a pleasant scent that enhances the overall experience. Moreover, it’s quite budget-friendly compared to other products available on the market. The convenient dropper allows for precise control over the amount dispensed, ensuring that just a small quantity is all you need for effective results. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this serum and its performance."

My favourite part about this is that it is more than just a vitamin c serum. It has niacinamide and salicylic acid. Both of these ingredients along with the vitamin c has helped give my skin a smoother and overall brighter look. It also has melasyl in it which is meant to help with dark spots. I have seen some improvement in my dark spots but I can’t say that it’s been significant in the short time that I have used it. The texture of the product is quite nice and it has a pleasant smell. It absorbs into my skin quite easily without making me feel greasy. It’s a great serum that wear well under makeup also."

        "review": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] Garnier Vitamin C Serum can improve brightness, fade newer dark spots, and smooth skin texture with regular use. It tends to feel non-greasy, lightweight, absorbs well, often with a mild citrus fragrance. Because it has several actives, it can combine brightening + mild exfoliation + calming, which means fewer separate products needed. However, the citrus scent and other fragranced components can irritate sensitive skin. Also, Vitamin C is sensitive to light and air, so a transparent bottle or frequent exposure may reduce effectiveness due to oxidation. Overall, it is affordable and worth trying."

Instead of applying it thinly, I apply a generous amount before bed and then apply a thin layer of moisturizer on top. After doing this for about a month, my skin tone has improved and my face looks a bit cleaner. Of course, I don't apply it during the day. During the day, I apply sunscreen thoroughly. I'm so happy with it that I purchased 5 of them and am considering buying more."

I tried using it on toner damp skin, and then waiting a minimum of 5 minutes before using a moisturiser. I tried using it on dry skin. It simply pilled off. I even tried mixing it with moisturiser, but all it did was make the moisturiser pill off. I've used other serums with bakuchiol and they sank in okay, so I don't know why this one wouldn't"

Works well under makeup as a base and a nice way to try bakuchiol without just adding stuff to a routine as it contains glycerin and niacinamide which act as a nice hydrator and resurfacer to the skin so you can swap out other products. My skin has also less irritation after 28 days of use. I recommended it to my sister who likes the product as well."

I going through menapause and I stared developing dark spots on my face , around my cheeks and upper lip. I have tried chemical peels, and so many other treatments and to no result. Then I came across this serum , since I had nothing to lose I gave it a try . To my surprise 😮 I saw a difference within a month of using twice a day and combining it with the sunscreen. I do have to say that I use the sunscreen with the serum at night too , I figure why not a little extra won’t hurt . I also ordered the face wash after two months to give it an extra push . Again I am so happy that this is working for me . Now do keep in mind that different products work different on different people and the product should be used as instructed and you have to use more then a month be patient and you have dark stubborn spots use the serum you will not be disappointed and what do you have to lose only your dark spots. Now I just ordered the dark circle cream . Crossing my fingers it works too . I will keep you all posted."

It has an easy dropper system where you push button on top and dab the drops required. I have found this very helpful as I can put more drops on my forehead and cheeks etc and use only 1 drop on eye area. SKIN has felt lovely (I also use neutrogena cleanser and moisturiser). Affordable products which can also be purchased discounted"

After a month of using this product, my skin is so so much better. Lovely brightness, it made my complexion even, no more marks. My fine lines disappeared (I’m 29 and only had the beginning of lines) and my skin has never been better overall. I like the smell and the feeling after the product is on my face. It doesn’t sting or burn. Definitely recommend this one to anyone starting on retinol."

        "review": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I have mixed feelings about this primer… the one thing that it did do really well was make my makeup sit nicely. I tried it out with both a lighter coverage skin tint base and a fuller coverage foundation, and both times using the primer did noticeably affect the smoothness of the makeup and evenness of the coverage. It’s also really satisfying to apply - when you tap it into your skin you can feel the primer turn from a smooth consistency into the grippiness it promises. However, in my experience the primer did not have any effect on how long my makeup lasted. I didn’t notice any difference between how my makeup lasted using this primer and no primer at all. All in all I would likely not repurchase the product because a key requirement of a primer in my opinion is that it makes makeup last longer."

This has definitely evened out my complexion and reduced the appearance of fine lines and sun spots so it’s well worth the money. My skin looks smoother and plumper when I use this and less tired and dull, it has actually brightened my skin quite a bit. I have sensitive skin and this has caused no irritation, which is great for a retinol product. I would highly recommend this serum"

For a similar price (or less) than what other brands charge for a 50ml jar, you can have 1 litre of CeraVe. That's the equivalent of 20 jars of other brands. This quantity of my previous moisturiser would have cost me over $700. For me it's a no-brainer."

It seems expensive compared to other brands where you can get 1L for less than half the price, but the bottle lasts a long time and is really worth it to help me keep up good habits.

I use this every day and have been for the past 6+ years. Before applying makeup, and every day after my shower.I highly highly reccomend this product and the brand !! Will never use another brand. And always will go to chemist warehouse, as they have the best prices. Considering I've used it for so so long."

I have been using the product every day after showering and the results are great. The cream is immediately absorbed into the skin and doesn’t leave a greasy residue. It has a pleasant, soft fragrance ideal for daily use. I have very dry skin and found my skin was well hydrated after each application. The only downside I experienced was how the lotion was applied. It did not spread easily but rather grabbed your skin as you applied it rather than gliding smoothly. Despite this small flaw I will continue to use the lotion daily as part on my beauty routine.

Now I no longer need to buy suncreens online from Europe or Asia."

I wear this every day because not only does it offer very high protection against UVA/UVB, it also gives a great glow to the skin without being greasy. Feels more like a serum and is also super hydrating. LOVE! LOVE! LOVE! French skincare brands are the way to go!"

The quality and finish is worth every cent in my opinion! No film, no redness, great for under foundation and blush. I cannot recommend enough!! Thank goodness for this brand, it’s has been a game changer for me. I use this brand for everything. The cicaplast hand cream is unbelievably good too."

        "review": "I was a loyal customer of another brand who also sell a reputable SPF product for several years. The sunscreen was affordable and served as a great foundation under make-up. Unfortunately, they changed the ingredients 'claiming' it was new and improved highlighting it was matte, lightweight, and not sticky, but the new formula is greasy, shiny, and didn't absorb into my skin. I spoke with a staff member to explain my disappointment and asked whether they had a product they could recommended. She kindly gave me a couple of samples ('Anthelios Invisible Fluid' and 'Anthelios XL Dry Touch') and I found my NEW favourite SPF, 'Anthelios Invisible Fluid'. This product absorbs beautifully! It provides even better SPF coverage and protection than the 'other' product that I had been using for years. It is on the pricey side however, for me, it is worth it. It has actually improved the look and texture of my skin. I hope La Roche doesn't change their formula any time soon because for me this product is a winner. I highly recommend it. Grab a sample or two to experience the difference. I will certainly be sticking to this product for years to come."

Perfect for everyone including people who hate the feeling of sunscreen and for women/men that use makeup. Great for all ages (not sure about babies). I’ve tried so many sunscreens from Chemist Warehouse, as well as expensive ones (from Mecca, Ultra Violette, Naked Sundays) as well as cosmetically elegant Asian sunscreen (BoJ, Round Lab, Biore, makeprem etc) yet the Hamilton still stands up to the test of time for being cosmetically elegant, trustworthy and reliable. Highly highly recommend this it is amazing!!"

        "review": "I agree with the other two reviewers. This is a great facial sunscreen. I used to use another well known sunscreen brand but their face sunscreen product I was using was discontinued. I tried this Hamilton branded Everyday face as it looked to be fairly similar in nature. I have found this Hamilton face sunscreen to be just as good, perhaps even better, than the other brand I used to use. It's a great neutral colour, it's not greasy, it has no perfume, and it spreads beautifully over moisturisers. In addition, once dry, it allows primers (optional) and other makeup item to be added beautifully. It holds up with these other products so well. It is not irritating at all and is a non-negotiable for me every morning (and adding more throughout the day if I'm going out in the intense sun throughout the length of the day). I recommend this wonderful face suncream."

It was brilliant, but it is very expensive for the tiny sample size that it comes in. Unfortunately it is not available in bigger bottles or pump packs. This is through no fault of Chemistware house but the La Roche Posay. A 50ml tube does not last long when being applied up to 3 times a day a childcare and at nearly 30 dollars a tube it becomes incredibly expensive. It is a great product though for sensitive skin."

It's on the richer side but not greasy, absorbs beautifully into the skin, and sits well under makeup. I also like that the pump means I can measure out a consistent dose every time. Love."

        "review": "Amazingly underrated. Got this for around $12 which is incredible. A light creamy moisturiser that sinks in very quickly and invisibly and gives a matte/satin finish. No tint whatsoever and is undetectable on the skin. Perfect for all skin types and skin tones, especially for those who hate the feeling of sunscreen on the skin, and it’s also perfect for use under makeup! It does not irritate my sensitive skin or eye and is perfect all year round. I alternate between many Aus brands and Korean brand sunscreens, yet this is the only one where I consistently reach for and have finished. This is the closest thing to cosmetically elegant Korean and Japanese sunscreens, yet works out even more affordable and much better suited for the Australian sun! I’ve been through at least 5 of the smaller tubes already after discovering it last year. So happy there’s a larger size and I’ve already bought enough for this coming Aussie summer. It’s the BEST sunscreen on the Aussie market and I would highly recommend it for everyone!!"

It can leave a bit of a greasy film like most sunscreens but its quite minor compared to usual sunscreen, it feels more like a moisturiser than sunscreen grease, if you want to protect against sunburn aswell as build your tan this product is definitely worth it!"

        "review": "First use of sunscreen this season and I'm reminded of the unusable tube with lid that does not properly open away from the outlet hole. It is bad enough it should have been recalled. Executives should lose their bonus for such a bad decision. Your customers are far less woke than your focus groups believe. Stuff up the product fundamentally and the poor reviews flood in. Nobody is cheering your sustainability credentials - instead we are in disbelief at the poor decision making allowing a tube that doesn't work. This sunscreen is quite different to others in formulation - it is highly water proof and doesn't come off until a hot shower or manually rubbing off with some effort. A very good all day sunscreen for on-water sports. However - you must use sufficient product - and the tube makes this very difficult! I was burnt the first time I used the product as the hopeless packaging made it hard to extract the sizeable handfulls required for proper application. Returning to the previous packaging will return this product to 5 stars."

        "review": "I love this sunscreen. Our family has used it for years and it never fails to protect our skin. However, the new packaging is awful. I understand and support sustainability etc but so much product is wasted as the tube crinkles and folds and becomes impossible to squeeze. Disappointing at this price point and hopefully something that will be rectified."

Pros: non-greasy (I touch my face and get a little transfer onto my finger, but my skin feels very soft and not gooey or sticky like some sunscreens make the skin feel), it doesn't sting eyes or skin (eye stinging is a deal breaker for me), goes on very smoothly and doesn't skip areas, goes on clear/ not white/ no cast, reasonable/ competitive price for a 200ml bottle. Cons: A bit shiny, but very standard look for sunscreen (I guess this cant be helped because it doesn't contain alcohol and is not advertised to be matte), the aluminum peel broke and I had a hard time opening the bottle. Best all round sunscreen I have used so far, and Ive gone through pretty much the entire sunscreen isle."

        "review": "This product is fantastic. We found it while we were up in Sydney over the Christmas holiday, looking for a sunscreen for me and my son. The dermaveen brand has always made skin friendly formulas that compliment my sensitive skin, and this is no different. It goes on like a moisturiser, but I have used this at the beach on hot sunny days and have not been hurt at the end of the day and I am a pale reflective white that will cause a blinding glare to any by standers at the beach. Overall, I could not recommend this product enough."
