I was using another product which costs $60 for removing make up but, after using other CeraVe's products, I thought I'd give this a go. It worked just as well - removes eye liner, mascara, foundation, eye shadow and also daily SPF if I'm not wearing make up. My approach to skincare has switched to practical now - what actually works and nourishes the skin. Will keep purchasing this. Price point is wonderful as well.",

I had tried so many different products to help it and some were ok, but in the end, they didn't give me the result I was looking for and the acne even got worse. Then I came across the foaming gel about a month or so ago. I already knew the brand because I had been using the BB cream and was happy with that, so I bought this and thought I'd give it ago - OMG! It has been incredible! It won't get rid of any acne you already have, sooth it and but it will prevent anymore from showing up. Now, my skin has become much clearer, the redness is almost all gone, it's gentle on my sensitive skin and makes my skin feel really soft after use. I'm never using anything else again.",

                "review": "The gel has a lightweight, clear texture that lathers nicely, and I love that it’s fragrance free, which makes it gentle on my sensitive skin. After a few weeks of consistent use, my face feels noticeably cleaner, less oily throughout the day, and I’ve seen fewer breakouts. My skin tone also looks more even, and I appreciate that it doesn’t strip my skin of moisture like other acne targeting cleansers often do. Overall, it’s become a staple in my skincare routine, and I’d highly recommend it to anyone with oily, acne prone, or sensitive skin.",

                "review": "I am in my mid-forties and I have oily, slightly olive skin, which used to be prone to breakouts, but is now smooth and completely free of wrinkles. I have used up two tubes of this product, which I've purchased both in-store and online. It is an effective formula for sensitive skin. I love the design of the tube, which dispenses the product in modest amounts and in its entirety; when I got towards the end of the tube, I didn't have to cut it open to get any residual product out, it emptied perfectly, and you can see this, as the tube is transparent. Both of these factors, (physical ease of use and transparency of packaging), are holy grails for me as a consumer! Very good product design in terms of packaging. It doesn't sting and my skin is left feeling and looking smooth. As I had considerable pigmentation prior to using it, I noticed more than 50% reduction, I'd say close to 80% reduction in pigmentation, which continues to improve over time. So it exceeds the manufacturer's estimates its effectiveness, in my experience. Another big tick there. I like the fact that in addition to salicylic acid, it also contains zinc PCA, which helps heal and stabilise the skin. It lasts about four months or so with twice daily use. Going back for another tube soon. I highly recommend this product to maintain skin clarity and even out skin tone.",

I’m a huge skin care fanatic yet have always struggled with textured skin/closed comedones, black heads, pimples here and there etc. I feel like I’ve tried it all, even gone down the fungal acne route. I just come across this cleanser randomly on a TikTok and thought why not? Even though I love my cetaphil (which I still use). Maybe for some reason I was drawn to it because whilst this brand seems decent, I still viewed it as an expensive hype and I find their products confusing. Take my money though!! This product is actually so cheap for what it is. I swear it has in only just a week made such a difference. My skin feels amazing after I cleanse with this. I use it every night. It’s very refreshing and tingly. Not abrasive, just smooth and sudsy. A little goes a long way. I can’t believe I’m potentially going to have smooth skin! It’s also very even toned and just so clean and clear. It’s added to my holy grail list. I find using it with Paulas Choice aha and toner has been a great combination",

So I thought I'd give this lotion a try as a Step 2 in my cleansing routine, instead of my usual Japanese lotion. Unfortunately I am quite disappointed. I like the gentle smell of it and how it leaves my skin matte after using it, but it doesn't do a good job removing makeup at all. Also it totally destroys the makeup pad in the process. It just starts fraying and falling apart, leaving fibers on my skin, which doesn't happen when I'm using my usual lotion. I regret buying this product and definitely won't buy it again.",

It's 2019, your skin doesn't need fragrance why do skin companies still include fragrance/perfume into their products, if anything it might cause a bad reaction if you are allergic or have sensitive skin !!!",

I have very dry extremely sensitive skin & the Neutrogena Ulta Gentle Toner doesn't sting my skin or make my skin feel dry or \"tight\" like other Toners I have tried in the past. I also think it would be very good for young girls who perhaps have combination skin & they are just beginning to use face products. I used Neutrogena facial soap to clean my skin from when I was about 17 & it was fabulous!! I'm now 69 & I have a lot of people tell me that I have beautiful skin! I wish Neutrogena still made their Hypoallergenic facial soap!! I would still use it to remove my make up & daily grime. Neutrogena is a Top Product!! You can't go wrong...but don't get this near your eyes.",

I have very dry skin and it's been playing up during my pregnant. I thought this was be too harsh or drying, or that my skin would be too sensitive, but I've loved it so far! I only use it every 2-3 days just in case it's too intense to use daily, but omgosh my skin feels so soft, smooth and clear since using it! I've also gone back to my Nivea soft cream (and OG) which I think has helped. Would definitely recommend this toner, and it smells lovely! Not strong but a subtle smell of rose water.",

It delivered on its promises — my skin feels plump, hydrated, and brighter, with no dryness at all. It’s also a fantastic base for makeup: non-greasy, quick to absorb, and works beautifully under foundation. I’ll definitely be repurchasing — it’s earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine.",

This serum features a vibrant yellow color and a lightweight, runny consistency that absorbs rapidly into the skin, leaving no sticky or greasy residue behind. One of the standout benefits I've experienced is its remarkable ability to diminish age spots and dark patches, resulting in a noticeably brighter and more even complexion. My skin feels significantly smoother and radiates a healthy glow. Additionally, the serum layers beautifully under moisturizers, making it a breeze to incorporate into my daily skincare routine. I also appreciate its delightful fragrance; unlike many other serums that tend to be odorless, this one has a pleasant scent that enhances the overall experience. Moreover, it’s quite budget-friendly compared to other products available on the market. The convenient dropper allows for precise control over the amount dispensed, ensuring that just a small quantity is all you need for effective results. Overall, I’m very satisfied with this serum and its performance.",

My favourite part about this is that it is more than just a vitamin c serum. It has niacinamide and salicylic acid. Both of these ingredients along with the vitamin c has helped give my skin a smoother and overall brighter look. It also has melasyl in it which is meant to help with dark spots. I have seen some improvement in my dark spots but I can’t say that it’s been significant in the short time that I have used it. The texture of the product is quite nice and it has a pleasant smell.

Because it has several actives, it can combine brightening + mild exfoliation + calming, which means fewer separate products needed.

The formulation is very hydrating and it pairs well with other products in my routine. Works well under makeup as a base and a nice way to try bakuchiol without just adding stuff to a routine as it contains glycerin and niacinamide which act as a nice hydrator and resurfacer to the skin so you can swap out other products. My skin has also less irritation after 28 days of use. I recommended it to my sister who likes the product as well.",

This one the results were instant and have only got better and better with use. I have been using it morning and night and haven’t worn make up in 2 weeks.

                "review": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I’ve been using the L'Oréal Le Duo Serum for a few weeks now, and I’m really impressed with the results! This dual-action serum combines two powerful formulas—one for hydration and the other for targeted skin concerns—giving my skin a noticeable boost in radiance and smoothness. Pros: ✔ Lightweight & Non-Greasy – Absorbs quickly without leaving a sticky residue. ✔ Hydrating & Smoothing – My skin feels softer and looks more even-toned. ✔ Easy to Apply – The dual-chamber pump dispenses the perfect amount. ✔ Pleasant Scent – Light and fresh, not overpowering. Cons: ➖ Might Not Suit All Skin Types – Those with very sensitive skin should patch-test first. ➖ Pricey for a Drugstore Brand – A little more expensive than other L'Oréal serums. Final Thoughts Overall, L'Oréal Le Duo Serum is a fantastic addition to my skincare routine. It delivers on its promises, leaving my skin feeling hydrated, smooth, and radiant. If you're looking for a multi-purpose serum with visible results, this one is worth trying!",

I going through menapause and I stared developing dark spots on my face , around my cheeks and upper lip. I have tried chemical peels, and so many other treatments and to no result. Then I came across this serum , since I had nothing to lose I gave it a try . To my surprise 😮 I saw a difference within a month of using twice a day and combining it with the sunscreen. I do have to say that I use the sunscreen with the serum at night too , I figure why not a little extra won’t hurt . I also ordered the face wash after two months to give it an extra push . Again I am so happy that this is working for me . Now do keep in mind that different products work different on different people and the product should be used as instructed and you have to use more then a month be patient and you have dark stubborn spots use the serum you will not be disappointed and what do you have to lose only your dark spots. Now I just ordered the dark circle cream . Crossing my fingers it works too . I will keep you all posted.",

The serum is lightweight and non-oily, feels silky on application and absorbs easily into the skin. The dropper allows easy application and even when applying it generously twice daily it would probably last about 3 months. Together the products leave my skin feeling moisturised but not oily and they leave my skin with a nice glow. They sit well under make-up too. Since using the serum and moisturiser my skin tone is more even, there seems to be a smoother texture, and overall my skin looks healthier. There has probably been a slight shift in fine lines but they weren't pronounced for me to start with. It smells pleasant, but it is quite strong and more like a perfume. I got used to it over time but I prefer natural and fresher fragrances so I would be more inclined to get it again if there was an alternative fragrance or a fragrance free option.",

                "review": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] I've had a great experience with the L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Tri-Peptides Serum. I have been using it for the past 6 weeks, in conjunction with the L’Oreal Paris Laser x3 Triple Action Moisturising Cream. It is a 30ml bottle, I am only a third of the way through which also makes it good value for money. The packaging is a lovely, red coloured, heavy bottle with a dropper to dispense the product. This addition makes it look like it could be a high end product that would have a much higher price point. The serum is super smooth and glides onto the skin. The serum does feel sticky initially but only for a brief few seconds while it dries. The serum then absorbs beautifully. It also gives a dewy finish. It is silky and smooth with a natural colour and texture. The fragrance is really a nice and pleasant floral scent, which is quite strong, but not in a bad way. I can see how this could be too strong for some, but in my opinion, I really liked it. I had no reaction whatsoever to the serum. It seems like this serum could be good for all skin types and tones. I found it was a good base for daily make up application. The main result for me was that I found my skin was definitely more hydrated and smoother after regular use. I took before and after photos, and there was definitely improvement. My skin seems more supple. Over Winter especially, my skin does feel drier than usual, so my skin feels a lot better and not tight and dry. I really can’t tell if there was any improvement to wrinkles or lines, but I am always sceptical when it comes to anything advertising improvements in relation to wrinkles. I feel we should wear our wrinkles and laugh lines proudly! I would recommend this product to anyone regardless of age. This product made my make up look smooth and flawless which was also a factor I put into mind throughout my experience of using it. I haven’t had any adverse reactions, marks or pimples appear on my face since I have been using this product. It makes my skin feel relaxed and cool and refreshed after my shower. I have also been spreading it onto my neck and I have noticed a significant improvement with that as well. The advertising and formulated ingredients appear to target those with mature skin, as it is labelled “Age-Correcting,” but I would actually recommend it to anyone. This is an amazing serum for dry skin, but when it comes to fine lines and wrinkles it doesn’t have an obvious effect. Maybe if you use it continuously for more that 6 week you may see differences with the lines, but for me, I saw no difference. Overall, I would recommend this product to people who want to get smoother skin, want a nice base before applying make up and people who struggle with dry skin, this is for them.",

I feel my skin felt firmer with a more even tone. My skin felt softer than it did previously also. The serum absorbs quickly and is quite light on the skin. Doesn’t leave any patches that aren’t absorbed. Easy to use, easy to apply. I’m impressed with the promise that L’Oréal has been committed to beauty without animal testing since 1989. I will continue to use the serum to hopefully continue seeing the benefits. Would buy again and recommend to others.",

It is a decidedly deliciously fruity smelling product! It contains Hylaronic acid and Vitamin C, as well as three Tri-peptides, Argireline, Synake and Matrixyl. These are all directed at the signs of aging in older skin, loss of skin firmness, wrinkles, uneven skintone and dehydration. Having all of these ingredients in one product makes your day and night routine so easy. The serum has, as I have already said, a delicious fruity fragrance, which did not bother my very sensitive skin. The texture is rich but not oily or greasy, and dries to a soft feeling finish, before finishing with moisturiser. I definitely believe that my skin did look softer and more plumped after about two weeks of use. I really enjoyed using this product.",

It was beautiful to apply, I waited a little bit for it too absorb before applying my day cream. It was hydrating and I had no adverse reactions.

As someone who usually invests in high-end skincare brands, I didn’t expect much from a drugstore product—but this serum has completely surprised me. The texture is silky and glides on smoothly without feeling greasy or heavy. It absorbs quickly into the skin, and the scent is light and pleasant—not overpowering at all. After consistent use, my skin looks noticeably brighter, fuller, and more hydrated. There’s a healthy glow that I wasn’t expecting, and some of the fine lines around my eyes and mouth appear softened. I honestly didn’t think a more affordable serum could deliver results on par with the luxury brands I’m used to, but this one does—and in some ways, it performs even better. I’ll definitely be continuing to use it. Highly recommend giving it a try if you're looking for visible results without the luxury price tag.",

Lightweight texture: it absorbs well, doesn’t leave a heavy or greasy film, which is great when skin is already dry and can’t handle heaviness. For very dry mature skin, one application of serum alone isn’t enough — skin can feel tight, especially overnight or in windy/low-humidity conditions. Needs a good cream or oil to seal in moisture. I generally like this kind of serum. I would recommend it especially because it's not expensive.",

                "review": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] If you’re looking for a serum that truly delivers visible results and transforms your skin, L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Tri-Peptides Serum is a game-changer. I’ve been using this serum consistently, and I can confidently say it has earned a permanent spot in my skincare routine. It combines powerful anti-aging technology with a lightweight, luxurious formula that makes my skin feel pampered every time I apply it. The first thing I noticed about this serum was its silky texture. It glides onto the skin effortlessly and absorbs quickly without leaving any sticky or greasy residue. That alone was impressive because I’ve tried other serums that felt heavy or took forever to sink in. This one feels like it instantly becomes part of your skin, leaving behind a smooth, hydrated canvas. It’s perfect whether you wear it alone or layer it under your moisturizer and sunscreen. What sets this serum apart is its Tri-Peptide technology, designed to target the signs of aging, particularly fine lines, wrinkles, and loss of firmness. Peptides are known to support collagen production, which is essential for maintaining skin’s structure and elasticity. Over time, I’ve noticed my skin looking firmer and more lifted, especially around areas that tend to show aging first, like my forehead and around my eyes. Another star ingredient is Hyaluronic Acid, a hydration powerhouse. My skin often feels dry, especially during colder months, but this serum provides lasting moisture without feeling heavy. It plumps the skin beautifully, giving it that fresh, dewy look that I love. After just a few weeks, my complexion looked more radiant and felt smoother to the touch. I also appreciate that this serum works well with the rest of my skincare products. It layers beautifully under both my day cream and night cream, and it doesn’t pill or cause any irritation. Even my makeup applies more seamlessly because my skin is so much smoother and better hydrated. The real magic, though, comes with consistent use. After about four weeks, I started noticing a visible reduction in the depth of my fine lines, especially around my mouth and eyes. My skin tone looked more even, and there was a noticeable “bounce” to my skin that I hadn’t seen in years. It’s like this serum breathed new life into my complexion, making it look healthier, firmer, and more youthful. Another big plus is the packaging. The sleek bottle comes with a precise dropper, so you get just the right amount every time without any mess or waste. It also feels hygienic, which is important when you’re dealing with skincare products. Overall, L’Oréal Paris Revitalift Laser Tri-Peptides Serum has exceeded my expectations. It delivers professional-level results at an accessible price point, making it a fantastic option for anyone wanting to target aging, dryness, or dullness. My skin feels firmer, looks brighter, and is more hydrated than it’s been in years. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for an effective, luxurious-feeling serum that truly works.",

My fine lines disappeared (I’m 29 and only had the beginning of lines) and my skin has never been better overall. I like the smell and the feeling after the product is on my face. It doesn’t sting or burn. Definitely recommend this one to anyone starting on retinol.",

It has a pleasant, soft fragrance ideal for daily use. I have very dry skin and found my skin was well hydrated after each application. The only downside I experienced was how the lotion was applied. It did not spread easily but rather grabbed your skin as you applied it rather than gliding smoothly. Despite this small flaw I will continue to use the lotion daily as part on my beauty routine.

This fast absorbing body lotion deeply nourishes my dry, rough patches leaving my skin feeling healthy, moisturised and oh so soft. Providing 48 hours of intensive moisturization with no greasy feel.

The sunscreen was affordable and served as a great foundation under make-up. Unfortunately, they changed the ingredients 'claiming' it was new and improved highlighting it was matte, lightweight, and not sticky, but the new formula is greasy, shiny, and didn't absorb into my skin. I spoke with a staff member to explain my disappointment and asked whether they had a product they could recommended. She kindly gave me a couple of samples ('Anthelios Invisible Fluid' and 'Anthelios XL Dry Touch') and I found my NEW favourite SPF, 'Anthelios Invisible Fluid'. This product absorbs beautifully! It provides even better SPF coverage and protection than the 'other' product that I had been using for years. It is on the pricey side however, for me, it is worth it. It has actually improved the look and texture of my skin. I hope La Roche doesn't change their formula any time soon because for me this product is a winner. I highly recommend it. Grab a sample or two to experience the difference. I will certainly be sticking to this product for years to come.",

I used to use another well known sunscreen brand but their face sunscreen product I was using was discontinued. I tried this Hamilton branded Everyday face as it looked to be fairly similar in nature. I have found this Hamilton face sunscreen to be just as good, perhaps even better, than the other brand I used to use. It's a great neutral colour, it's not greasy, it has no perfume, and it spreads beautifully over moisturisers. In addition, once dry, it allows primers (optional) and other makeup item to be added beautifully. It holds up with these other products so well. It is not irritating at all and is a non-negotiable for me every morning (and adding more throughout the day if I'm going out in the intense sun throughout the length of the day). I recommend this wonderful face suncream.",

A 50ml tube does not last long when being applied up to 3 times a day a childcare and at nearly 30 dollars a tube it becomes incredibly expensive. It is a great product though for sensitive skin.",

No tint whatsoever and is undetectable on the skin. Perfect for all skin types and skin tones, especially for those who hate the feeling of sunscreen on the skin, and it’s also perfect for use under makeup! It does not irritate my sensitive skin or eye and is perfect all year round. I alternate between many Aus brands and Korean brand sunscreens, yet this is the only one where I consistently reach for and have finished. This is the closest thing to cosmetically elegant Korean and Japanese sunscreens, yet works out even more affordable and much better suited for the Australian sun! I’ve been through at least 5 of the smaller tubes already after discovering it last year. So happy there’s a larger size and I’ve already bought enough for this coming Aussie summer. It’s the BEST sunscreen on the Aussie market and I would highly recommend it for everyone!!",

It is bad enough it should have been recalled. Executives should lose their bonus for such a bad decision. Your customers are far less woke than your focus groups believe. Stuff up the product fundamentally and the poor reviews flood in. Nobody is cheering your sustainability credentials - instead we are in disbelief at the poor decision making allowing a tube that doesn't work. This sunscreen is quite different to others in formulation - it is highly water proof and doesn't come off until a hot shower or manually rubbing off with some effort. A very good all day sunscreen for on-water sports. However - you must use sufficient product - and the tube makes this very difficult! I was burnt the first time I used the product as the hopeless packaging made it hard to extract the sizeable handfulls required for proper application. Returning to the previous packaging will return this product to 5 stars.",

It can leave a bit of a greasy film like most sunscreens but its quite minor compared to usual sunscreen, it feels more like a moisturiser than sunscreen grease, if you want to protect against sunburn aswell as build your tan this product is definitely worth it!",

Pros: non-greasy (I touch my face and get a little transfer onto my finger, but my skin feels very soft and not gooey or sticky like some sunscreens make the skin feel), it doesn't sting eyes or skin (eye stinging is a deal breaker for me), goes on very smoothly and doesn't skip areas, goes on clear/ not white/ no cast, reasonable/ competitive price for a 200ml bottle. Cons: A bit shiny, but very standard look for sunscreen (I guess this cant be helped because it doesn't contain alcohol and is not advertised to be matte), the aluminum peel broke and I had a hard time opening the bottle. Best all round sunscreen I have used so far, and Ive gone through pretty much the entire sunscreen isle.",
