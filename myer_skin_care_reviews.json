I have loved this cleanser but recently I think a formula has changed without notification and I have been waking up with swollen eyes and itchy red and patchy skin. I didn't want to believe it was this cleanser since I have been using it for a while. But I can't find out anything else I could be reacting to only on my face last night when using it after I rinsed it was almost immediate swelling and redness. I am going to see a doctor to confirm and if I am now allergic to this product I am going to be very disappointed as I just made a new order and began using after running out of my last order. It has been the only thing that has worked for me and now I don't know what I can use. I love this brand but a product change from something amazing to cause such severe reaction is really disappointing. I hope The Ordinary can look into this and make changes back to the original or remove whatever is causing reactions, because going through other reviews I see that there is an influx of recent allergic reactions to this product, which is supposed to be their most gentle cleanser highly recommended by dermatologist.",

Before discovering this Glucoside Foaming Cleanser at Myer, I was actually ordering my same dermatologist-recommended brand from India because nothing in Australia worked for me. I tried popular drugstore brands, but they just didn't suit my sensitive skin. This cleanser has been nothing short of amazing. It’s gentle, doesn't irritate my skin at all, and effectively cleanses without leaving it feeling stripped or dry. After two years of searching, my skin has finally found a product it loves here in Australia. Interestingly, this product was also my introduction to Myer. I hadn't shopped at Myer in the two years since I moved here, but this one purchase changed everything. Now, I find myself going to Myer frequently just to browse and shop for other products. This cleanser didn't just solve my skincare problem; it introduced me to a fantastic store. I highly, highly recommend it to anyone, especially those with sensitive skin!",

It feels hydrating and comfortable throughout the day, which is perfect for my skin. The added SPF 20 is a great bonus, offering a bit of extra protection. While the shade range isn’t as extensive as some other foundations, I personally haven’t had any issues finding a good match. Overall, it’s a beautiful foundation that balances moisture, coverage, and sun protection really well.",

My hair actually felt soft after using it (?? what?!), and I barely saw any breakage. The flyaways were way more under control too, which never happens for me. The heat doesn’t feel super intense, which made me think it would take forever to dry my hair, but nope, it’s fast! Somehow gentle and effective. Anyway, if you’ve got fine hair and the usual drying frizzy struggle, this one’s definitely worth trying.",

          "body": "[This review was collected as part of a promotion.] My wife has been using the Panasonic Moisture Infusion Nanoe Technology Hair Dryer (model EH-NA0J-N765), and we're both really impressed. First off, it's super lightweight and compact, which makes it easy to handle and great for travel. Despite its size, it's packed with advanced features. The Panasonic Nanoe hair dryer has four mode settings: Hot, Hot & Cold, Scalp, and Skin. There are also three blow levels (airflow levels) with clear corresponding indicator lights. You can have a traditional hot air blow, a more refined Scalp or Skin mode smooth airflow, or automatically switch between hot and cold airflow. What really stands out are its different modes, especially for skin and hair care. The dryer provides a gentle airflow that moisturizes your scalp and is very soft on your face, particularly when you use the Skin and Scalp modes. You won't get that uncomfortable blast of hot air that some dryers have. What I particularly like is that in Skin mode, it defaults to the lowest air speed, and users are not allowed to change the airflow speed. This helps reduce accidental pressing of the airflow button, which could potentially cause skin damage or excessive dry skin. The Scalp mode has moisture-enhancing features, which have been tested in laboratory conditions. Similar features and enhancements are also provided with the Skin mode. This gentle approach is fantastic for retaining moisture, which is especially helpful during the dry Australian winter. It's reassuring to know that the dryer has been laboratory tested since 2023, confirming its quality and effectiveness. Given how easy it is to use, its smart design, and all its great features, we definitely recommend this hair dryer.",

Even though I'm pale (hence choosing the lighter shade) I then bought a slightly darker shade wondering if this would help. It didn't. In daylight it looked a bit better, but in shade still gave a sheen of 'ghost-like / ill'. Having spent alot of money on this product it's very high on my todo list to contact Dior and ask for a refund (for both shades). I wouldn't even use this as a last resort, it's that bad. I've never done a face or clothing product review in my life, but Dior Prestige Light-inWhite has left me with no option but to be honest. Please give my money back.",
