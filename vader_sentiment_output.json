Nivea has been my holy grail in terms of skin care up until recently. This version of Cetaphil scrub has safer and better ingredients than the more popular gentle cleanser. One of the most noticeable advantages this has over Nivea is the moisture retention you get on your face post using this product. This seldom makes your face dry and visible differences can be seen right after the first use. Plus, it has been bamboo and coconut extracts which are very good for your face. Quality: / Quantity: / Packaging: / Effectiveness: / The product is made in Germany. No wonder its so good.",

Perfect for sensitive skin prone to breakouts and redness (hypoallergenic and non-comedogenic). The tube in itself is sturdy and compact. Consistency - watery gel with mild granulations. Amount required - very, very little (which makes the price worth it. It'll last you for ages.) Scent - clean and refreshing, one of the main things that attracted me. Lather - not bubbly, but obvious. Washing off - wash off at least twice to remove the residue. In my experience, that's how much is required. Feel - a thorough cleanse. Skin may feel a little tight subsequently, but that's the case with most soaps or facewashes.",

        "review": "I bought this product after seeing various James Welsh videos.I must say that I have never been adjusted with the skincare, so my skin was in critical condition, also for the prolonged use of the mask, which obviously does not help. I saw results using the product for just one week, and at the beginning I was skeptical. I recommend using this Cleanser, because although I only use this and a face cream, the results can be seen.The skin is decidedly more hydrated and has a healthier appearance. Obviously this is a medium quality product (apparently), because the boy recommends three, for three different price ranges, but it makes his and is in a life format, essentially. I will certainly have to add other products to the list to make my skin healthier, but I admit that this will be part of the list. I recommend choosing the type of cleanser based on the type of skin you have, so it will do better its job.I hope I have been useful to you!",

Despite the heat periods and the constant use of the mask, its skin is decidedly more hydrated and has a much healthier appearance (it does not use other types of creams) Excellent for daily cleaning, I used it even after using an oily product to remove merged (paying attention to the eyes).",

It does not leave foam when applying it on the skin and is very soft with it, it fulfills the function of cleaning it perfectly. I feel that for dry skin you can go better. I also like the large amount that comes for the price it has.It is a product that I recommend without any doubt, for me it is indispensable for facial cleaning routines.",

Chapeau to the seller who, despite the current situation and the fact that Amazon indicated the date of arrival between and April (ordered on evening), went to me the package on !Well sealed and with the receipt.",

The formula is perfect for normal to oily skin, and its non-comedogenic, so I dont have to worry about breakouts. I love that its fragrance-free and packed with ceramides and niacinamide to help maintain my skin barrier. This cleanser removes excess oil and makeup effortlessly while keeping my skin balanced. Highly recommend it to anyone with acne-prone.",

Although it is a foaming cleaner, I can't find abrasive at all.Leave clean and fresh skin without that feeling of trenching that other products usually cause.I have been using it both for the face and for the body and, until now, my skin has responded very well.In summary, it is an excellent option if you have delicate skin and look for a soft but effective cleaner.",

From the first use, the skin is smoother, I would never have imagined with such immediate effects.I have mixed skin and I think this is the most effective solution for those in my situation because it is not at all aggressive on the skin, however it perfectly does its job.Since I started using it the pimples that I had good or bad every day have gone disappeared, the stains have also lightened. I will definitely buy it, however, I recommend using it together with a good moisturizing cream.",

        "review": "Convenient, perfume without perfume (for some people it can be irritating), pleasant texture, full of soothing agents, moisturizers, niacinamide (seboregulatory) and above all it does perfectly what a good face cleansing should do: removing the makeup and dirt of the day (and it does it really very well) without having to use an exaggerated amount (a dose is enough, in practice by crushing the pump only one time)that pulls. It is really formulated so that it does not attack our protective barrier, on the contrary it helps her to be stronger.So much so that I, after years of wrong and aggressive treatments and products, had come to have a chapped skin around the nose and the mouth and skin in general very sensitive and reactive to everything.After a single month of cleansing morning and evening (accompanied by a simple moisturizing cream in the evening and the sun cream during the day) I was able to see the fur disappears and be happy to have a skin again whose barrier manages to protect me. PS.Bought on May , and I am writing the review on September , ;I still have a quarter of the bottle despite having used it religiously morning and evening, every day.My skin is plumped, it has no discomfort and no longer reacts by continuously blushing with every small touch.Do you!",

        "review": "Ive been using CeraVe Foaming Facial Cleanser for oily skin for a few weeks now, and its been a total game changer for my skincare routine! I have struggled with oily skin for years, constantly dealing with that midday shine and occasional breakouts. This cleanser has truly helped balance my skin. The formula is gentle but effective, removing excess oil and impurities without leaving my face feeling stripped or dry. I love that it includes ceramides and hyaluronic acid, which help to keep my skin hydrated and maintain its natural barrier. After using this cleanser, my skin feels clean, refreshed, and soft. Ive also noticed a significant reduction in breakouts and overall oiliness throughout the day. It has a nice, light lather and rinses off easily, leaving no residue behind. If you have oily or combination skin, I highly recommend giving CeraVe a try. Its made a noticeable difference for me, and Ill definitely be sticking with it!",

I have always had oily skin and with acne outbreaks although over the years the thing has calmed down, with this of the nightmares the nightmare has returned. I started buying fat products and only got worse, these products are very aggressive, they eliminate fat but also hydration and end with dry skin, full of pieties and creating times more fat ... it is a loop ... I will not wind much more and I will say that it is the best cleaner I have tried in my life, seriously, notes that leaves your skin clean but soft, hydrated ... I will also tell you that my outbreaks disappeared, some escape granite but nothing from the other world, something punctual although this may be due to the set of what I use. For those who have this problem, I will give you my routine in case you can help you. Cerave + Niacinamide % The Ordinary + Moisturizer (the one that works best for you) I use the merchanta for fat skin of . but I think they have removed it ... With this I have my face better than ever, I hope it serves you;)",

This cleanser is formulated for normal to oily skin, which is perfect for my skin type. I love that its fragrance-free, so its gentle on my sensitive skin and doesnt cause any irritation. The foaming gel texture is refreshing, and it does an excellent job at removing oil and impurities without leaving my skin feeling stripped or dry. I especially appreciate the inclusion of ceramides, niacinamide, and hyaluronic acid. The ceramides help maintain my skins protective barrier, while hyaluronic acid keeps it hydrated. Niacinamide has also been great for reducing the appearance of my pores and evening out my skin tone.",

The problem I had was not only when I double cleanse my skin doesn't like that so instead I cleanse with BOJ balm or this gel cleanser and then use a toner to make sure everything is removed. But the other problem was when I used it with the water too warm and it flared my rosacea. For the last few evenings I've used this without any other cleanser and lukewarm or cool water and my skin does so much better. Just love BOJ! ---Original review --- I don't use this BOJ Green Plum cleanser every day. This is only for those occasions when I double cleanse after wearing a particularly heavy SPF sunscreen, or maybe if I wear makeup (which is rare since I work remotely). It's a little drying for my dry aging skin. If you have more oily skin, you may love this. I am biased to Beauty of Joseon products, so basically they can do no wrong - lol - but this isn't my favorite cleanser since it is a little drying. Though they do indicate it is 'pore cleansing' so that should have been my clue! I love BOJ ginseng oil based cleanser. And their cleansing balm. Those are my go-tos. I use the oil based cleanser every day. I'll use the balm as the first step in double cleansing or use it on its own for makeup or SPF removal. I won't reorder this but it's not because it is not a great cleanser, it's just not for my aging rosacea-prone skin type.",

The cleansing action is pretty gentle but feels effective as a cleanser without drying or irritation. The ingredients seem decent, with a few natural herbs inside. There is a neutral smell that is of light strength and ok, it is a kind of generic cleanser type of smell with a hint of the herbal ingredients, it only appears when applying to the face but goes away after washing. Overall adequate enough for me to integrate into my morning and night face wash routine.",

        "review": "I don't suffer from acne but I do like to use a exfoliating cleanser a few times a week, so I ordered this BHA Acne Foam Cleansing made by NatureONE. The main blemish busters in this cleanser are lauric acid and salicylic acid. Salicylic acid has been around forever and is a proven success for fighting acne, but newer studies have shown that lauric acid also has a lot of potential for attaining clear skin. In addition to those, this product also contains the antibacterial chlorphenesin, and a good blend of humectants and emollients. I had hoped that the hydrating and moisturizing ingredients in this cleanser would help it to not dry out my skin so much. It's definitely a trade-off - after using this cleanser my skin does feel tight and slightly dry but it's worth it to me for the benefit of the BHA in it. And besides, I always moisturize after cleansing. There is no added fragrance in this cleanser but it does smell of the peppermint oil that it contains. It has decent foaming action and I love that the surfactants and preservatives used are not harsh. It is a pretty clean formula with no sulfates, parabens, cyclic silicones or fragrance, but it does contain polyethylene glycol in the form of PEG- hydrogenated castor oil. The issue with PEGs is that during their creation toxic byproducts are released, which can then contaminate the final product. These toxic byproducts include ethylene oxide, a known carcinogen and ,-dioxane, a suspected carcinogen. I avoid skin care products with PEGs, so after using this cleanser a couple times I have stopped. Currently this cleanser is selling for $. and that is a pretty good deal considering all the good ingredients it contains. One star docked for the presence of a PEG, but other than that it is a nice cleanser.",

My skin tends to be more on the dry side and using this face cleanser left my skin feeling clean, but also more dry. My wife who has oily skin used this and actually really liked it. She thought the cleanser left her face feeling clean without completely feeling like her skin has been stripped of its natural oils. The cleanser itself actually foams up pretty well and other than having slightly dryer skin, I didn't experience any skin irritation, but would caution sensitive skin users to be a little more careful before trying this cleanser.",

        "review": "I have a couple teens in the house, so this product has been getting some good use with positive feedback. I tried it on myself before putting it in the kids bathroom and was pleased with its performance. The foaming action does something to really cut the grit and grim, making my face feel super soft and squeaky clean after rinsing. A big bonus to me is my dry zones are less dry and my oily zones are clean and less shiny. It rinsed off easily and left my face feeling slightly tingly and very clean. The kids have since reported that while they haven't seen any reduction in acne, they do feel like it cleans better than their previous cleanser and no one has had any adverse reaction while using it.",

I have very oily skin that gets an occasional breakout but it's not anything that's out of control. Either way, my pores do get a bit clogged from time to time, especially during the cooler fall and winter months. First off all, going on, this is the most cooling moisturizer I've ever tried and it's so soothing on my skin. I'm thankful it's not overly drying, nor have I had a bad reaction to it at all. I'm guessing the balance of acids, glycerin, castor oil and other skin loving ingredients really help me out here. Regardless, I'm liking what I'm seeing and I think I may have found a new favorite!",

The fragrance is invigorating - pure, clean mint. Nothing mediciney here, it's very natural peppermint. The cleanser is a creamy silky lotion that foams up into a serious lather. Only a small amount of product is needed to wash the face, the lather is very rich. Skin feels soft and supple once the foam is rinsed away. I've noticed a reduction in breakouts and dullness since washing with this cleanser twice daily and it causes no irritation or sensitivity to my skin. The tube is a fairly generous ml or . fl. oz., and this cleanser is a good deal because you only need a small amount to get super clean.",

My only complaint is that it smells very strongly of tea tree, which I personally don't like. If you don't mind though, then it's excellent value.",

I looked it up and it's not good at all, my skin has been dried out and damaged from this facewash.",

Its super gentle on the skin but still leaves my face feeling clean without that tight, dry feeling afterward. The scent is kind of herbal/tea tree-ish, not super strong, but worth mentioning in case you're sensitive to fragrance. Personally, I dont mind it. The gel texture is really nice and easy to work into the skin, and it rinses off easily too. It works well for my dry skin, clears away the overnight dirt in the morning, and its also great as a second cleanser at night. Doesnt mess with my skin barrier or cause breakouts, which is a big win for me. Overall, a great everyday cleanser thats affordable and reliable. If you like your skincare simple but effective, this is a solid choice.",

I have sensitive, combination skin, and its hard to find a cleanser that cleans without stripping my face. This one ticks all the boxesits gentle, effective, and leaves my skin feeling refreshed without any tightness. The low pH formula really helps maintain my skins balance, which is important to avoid breakouts and irritation. I also love that it contains tea tree oil and BHA, which keep my pores clear and calm any redness. Even though its called a morning cleanser, I use it both day and night, and it works beautifully every time. The gel texture feels soothing, and it lathers just the right amount without being too foamy. Plus, the ml bottle lasts a long time since a little bit goes a long way. Its also fragrance-free, which is a bonus for those with sensitive skin or anyone avoiding strong scents. If youre looking for a reliable, gentle daily cleanser that works for all skin typesespecially sensitive or acne-pronethis one is a must-try! Ill definitely be repurchasing.",

Although, I noticed that my forehead looks slightly red after I wash it off, but it fades away pretty quickly and it doesn't feel agitated or anything. Also the tea tree smell is quite strong so if you're not a fan, I wouldn't recommend this. It is good at cleansing my skin without stripping it so far, but I'll have to use it for more than a month to see if it has any additional skin benefits like it claims to. Overall, it seems like a really great product for the price.",

        "review": "I was a bit skeptical because of the horror stories I have seen on YouTube and other reviews but Im really glad I went for it because this product doesnt irritate my skin or make me break out at all. In fact, every time I use it (I use it at night even though it says good morning which is totally fine) it leaves my skin with this slight glow, which is awesome! It doesnt strip my skin at all like my other cleansers did which messed up my skins natural ph balance and actually CAUSED acne (Grrr skincare industry). If yall havent looked at ph balanced products, you need to unless you want to have acne forever. If you destroy your skins natural moisture barrier and ph levels, you are essentially removing the fence your skin is trying to put up to protect itself which allows all kinds of bacteria to come in and have an acne party on your face. Im using this as a part of my skincare regimen to help restore my skins natural barrier. The product has also helped fade my acne scars and assist with redness. Sometimes I will feel a zit brewing underneath my skin and it wont even come out. I think this is due mainly to the tea tree oil and possibly the evening primrose oil in this. I honestly dont care though because whichever ingredient is responsible for doing this is working. On that note, the product definitely smells like Tea Tree oil. Some people may think the scent smells like chemicals but this is really just the natural scent pure Tea Tree oil has. I personally like it but if the smell is not for you, it doesnt linger at all. A little goes a long way with this product- it is very silky and suds up just slightly when you gently massage it into your skin. The product takes about a week to arrive at least to Texas (I think it must actually ship from Korea lol) but it was worth the wait. I would definitely recommend.",

I have combination skin, but prone to an oily T zone more so with hormonal changes. I use my vibration rubber face cleaner with mine. I work it from my forehead right the way down just past my decolite, makes my skin soft, bright and not dry or tight at all. Will definitely buy again",

        "review": "Ive been using the ANUA Heartleaf Quercetinol Pore Deep Cleansing Foam for a little while now, and overall, its been a pretty good experience. The first thing I noticed is its creamy texture and how much foam it creates a little goes a long way, and the lather feels really soft and luxurious on the skin. Its super gentle, which makes it great for daily use without stripping away moisture. While my skin feels refreshed and smooth after using it, Im not entirely sure if its doing a deep cleanse for my pores as it claims. I havent noticed a big difference in pore visibility or deep cleaning effects, but as a basic foamy cleanser, it works well for getting rid of surface impurities. If youre looking for a soft, gentle, and foamy cleanser that leaves your skin feeling clean and fresh, this one is worth trying. Just dont expect a miracle when it comes to deep pore cleaning. Still, its a nice product that feels good on the skin!",

        "review": "First of all I want to comment that I am a number fan of the Skincare Koreanos. I have mixed skin with tendency to skin with texture, that is, they come out, the so -called white points, which are clogged pores (nothing white is seen), of which you have to exfoliate. Functionality \"Says\" that it is a deep pore cleaners, to be honest I do not see the difference to other brands For me it is still a simple cleaner just like another, it even seems better cod and is cheaper. APPEARANCE He has a gentle smell of mentol (something that I liked) The first times to use it, it was difficult for the product to come out and go super compact Subsequent days was something between liquid and solid, something very strange and it seemed to me that it was not right and it began to cause distrust with the product. So before taking it out, I move it a little and come out as in the photo (but never imagine in life I had seen a soap that happened to him) On the other hand when rubbing it in the hands it gives a soft foam and then placed on the face, which the sensation is tasty It doesn't leave you dry skin and it's nice. Another negative point is that at night I use double cleaning, first the oil and then this soap. And although with each one it takes about seconds (they count the time and you will see that it is enough) and sometimes I have remains of makeup (eye I do not use waterproof makeup), so I put more in doubt its effectiveness CONCLUSION. I think those Videos of Tiktok and Instagram where they say that this product is miracles is false, it does not seem to me to do their job well, according to the benefits they sell. In short, I would not buy it again, I prefer the Cerave, whose price is much lower, clean better or equal but also has Niamina",

What really impressed me, though, was how soft and smooth my skin felt afterward. No tightness, no greasy residue, just clean, calm skin. It also has a subtle, calming scent that makes the cleansing routine feel almost spa-like. Plus, my pores look more refined and my skin feels more balanced overall. If youre into double cleansing or just want a gentle yet effective oil cleanser, I cant recommend this enough.",

        "review": "I am VERY satisfied with this product so far. It has far exceeded my expectations of a face wash. I am a yr old melanated woman and I smoke - that makes a difference in your skin. I live in the Midwest and it's February so cold frigid dry air right now. I notice that every winter my skin has a number of issues; dry patches, irritated acne, flakey, uneven tone/ashy, and fatigued looking. My face itches for no reason. I try a mixture of tea tree oil and moisturizer, nothing. I wash my face with Cetaphil as I have for over decades, nothing. I finally accepted that it was time to change my routine and products. But I'm not a big consumer of makeup or skin care. I used Cetaphil and ponds for years and it has worked. My best friend recommended this and other products to cleanse, tone, tighten, even, and SPF protector. Reluctantly I ordered it. I received it on February th, today is the th and I already am overwhelmed with hope for this face cleanser. When I got it my face was irritated and itchy so I was a little scared to try it but within the time I've had it, the irritation has greatly deminished and my face doesn't itch as much or as long. My face looks clearer and brighter. I notice I had a little white pimple on my chin days ago. Usually I would've popped it but I wanted to see the product work in real time and it has. I see it literally drying up and my skin isn't crusty or flakey. When I pat my face, I can see the skin that was exfoliated simply peel or wipe away. The effectiveness of this product is exactly what I read and what I needed! Lastly, a little goes a long way so start out with a pea sized amount and if you need to go up(which you shouldn't) DO NOT ADD TOO MUCH! I paid less for this than Cetaphil, so the price makes me super happy and it will last just as long. **Open your pores with hot water but rinse with cooler water. Pat dry.",

This product is amazing!!!!! Usually within an hour or two after washing my face it already starts feeling oily and gross. Ive used it for two days now and can already see and feel a HUGE difference. My skin is super smooth, I dont feel like I need to wash my face again hours after I use it, I can already see less inflammation. For once in a loooong time I feel like I have normal skin.

Sooo when I don't already have irritation on my skin by these activities, I use this and my skin feels more even and soft. I recommend to you and don't use it every day the first time as the AHA BHA can be a bit irritating at first. Also, I recommend this for night routine than morning routine personally.",

Perfect for both face and body, especially if you have sensitive skin. What I liked: Fragrance-free and super gentle - great for sensitive skin. Doesnt strip moisture but still cleans well. Works on both face and body, so its versatile. Huge L bottle lasts ages - good value for money. What I didnt like: Doesnt foam, so it might feel different if youre used to bubbly cleansers. Might not remove heavy makeup completely - best paired with a makeup remover. If you need a no-fuss, gentle cleanser that works for daily use, this ones a winner!",

        "review": "My Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser (L) arrived on time and was in good condition (now, mostly used). Thank you Amazon (Au) for same day dispatch and Amazon Logistics for a fast, personal and safe delivery. My face began to feel tight and hard as though it had been starched after using my usual cleanser, for some time. I knew that I needed to change to another more gentle cleanser. I tried using a little Sorbolene cream, but found that its oily / greasy character required extensive rinsing. Very inconvenient. Luckily, Amazon had Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser on a deal. So I tried it. Cetaphil Gentle Skin Cleanser has a smooth consistency. It doesn't feel oily or greasy (unlike sorbolene). Cetaphil has the viscosity of a lotion. It is easily spread over the skin, leaving it well coated. There is little wastage from dripping / falling off the skin like some other thicker cleansers. It can be readily washed or wiped off the skin. Personally, l like to apply my cleanser to damp / wet skin. Upon use, I found Cetaphil to be a soothing, non irritating cleanser that left my face feeling clean and refreshed, without any skin tightness. What a relief from the worry of trying to find a suitable cleanser for a reasonable price. An effective cleanser that leaves the natural oils / fats necessary for good skin health, whilst leaving the skin feeling clean.",

        "review": "This product is amazing. It is different from the old formula. This new improved gentle cleanser is very very creamy. Much creamier then the older version. It is milky white in colour and fragrance free. I enjoyed using it. It felt like nice lotion on the skin and cleansed without burning or drying my skin out ( I have a sensitive skin on my face). Thoroughly recommend this new version of Cetaphil Gentle cleanser to everyone with sensitive and dry skin.",

I came out with contact dermatitis on my neck, under my eye, and on both eyelids. Contact dermatitis is extremely painful and horrible to experience. The skin underneath my eye and my cheekbone area was swollen for over a month while I tried to get it under control. I do not recommend this product, and I am very disappointed that a brand that is supposed to be for sensitive skin is now unsuitable. Disappointing!",

I'm guessing it's a reaction to either Sodium Cocoyl Isethionate or Sodium Benzoate. Whilst this could just be a me problem, the product smells bad and leaves skin feeling gross afterwards so I wouldn't recommend it anyway even if I wasn't apparently allergic to this. Choose anything but this.",

It's been difficult to find a face wash I can use everyday that didn't dry out or irritate my face. From the top of my head I've tried the face shop foaming cleanser, cetaphil, olehenrikson, and kiehls (latest), and they all had varying problems. Kiehl's made my skin a bit better, but it wasn't something I was able to use everyday as it dried it out too much. This is the only cleanser so far that I can use twice a day which doesn't leave my skin feeling overly tight, have dry spots, make my face red/itchy, or break out in skin colored bumps. My face normally can't stand using a face wash twice a day (or even washing twice a day), however it tolerates this one. It doesn't have a very distracting scent (its very slight) and cleans my skin adequately. It feels fresh, clean, and gentle. It's a bit hard to squeeze out of the bottle, but you don't need to use so much anyway and it lathers easily enough. I'm really happy I finally found something that doesn't make my skin angry.",

I have combo skin that's dry immediately after cleansing, but then gets oily in the t-zone throughout the day. I normally use non- or low-foaming cleansers with pH .-ish as they're not drying after I finish cleansing. Social media got me to try this cleanser since so many people were claiming it was foamy, but non-drying. While it is definitely very foamy, with a thick, velvety foam, it was drying on my skin. I use it as a second cleanser after an oil cleanser and it seems to work well as a second cleanser. It has a faintest plasticky scent which does not bother me. While it's not an ideal cleanser for my preference, I'll continue to use it up.",

Super cute, yet simple. There are instructions in English on the unicarton and Korean instructions on the actual product. The ingredients are clearly listed and the produst itself was sealed. Use: Pretty straightforward stuff, wet, lather, and rinse, right? That being said, this cleanser is a bit different. It DOES lather up, but with the addition of deep sea salt, the lather disappates quickly, (So yeah, that picture was taken rather QUICKLY) but of course, a little more water, and you're good to go! As with most ROUND LAB products, a little really does go a long way, so you really don't need to use a ton of product to get the good results! The formula is nice and soft, easy on, easy off and... it's hard to explain, but after rinsing, my face did \"dry down\" but it wasn't \"dry-dry\" (I hope that makes sense!) Notes: One thing I did notice that isn't a detractor or anything, is that the Sea Salt DOES act as a micro-exfoliant. So definitely be aware of that if you're sensitive to those sorts of things. I do believe it's safe to use for daily use, though, I won't personally be using it during my nighttime routine, just my morning one. (I'm also not a professional, so take that with a grain of Deep Sea Salt!) Overall: Round Lab has done it again! And for someone with Oily/Combo skin, this, paired with the rest of their line (and other K-beauty skin products) keep my face happy and clean!",

The con for me is it DOES sting eyes. No matter how hard I try, because it foams up a lot, it eventually reaches my eyes by the time Im done rubbing my face. Other than that, it is a good cleanser. I have dry sensitive skin and usually stay away from foam cleansers because they are overly drying. This one does not dry me out afterwards and my skin feels like it has bounce to it even after only cleansing. I think there are other good K cleansers out there that I would try before purchasing this again, but if someone has oily/sensitive skin I think this would suit them great.",

Also, my skins would slightly sting when applying my moisturizer with ceramides afterwards. It was a mild nuisance. Overall, I was satisfied with this purchase.

My skin does not feel stripped of any moisture and it does not feel tight or dry. I just cannot get over the scent, almost as though its plastic thats burnt with an earthy scent. Im the kind of person that does not get bothered by scents of certain products but that was more than I can handle.

(Korean brand) This cleanser obvious key ingredient is .% Salicylic Acid, Laurie Acid, Teatree leaf oil, Salicylic Alba Bark Water and Glycerine. This is design to melt away impurities, it gently removes dirt, excess oil and product build up whilst replenishing moisture. This leaves your skin feeling soft, visibly clearer and boast your skins natural glow. My experience- my skin type is dry/sensitive This has a white thick gel like texture, also has a teatree/willow scent to it. It is easy to lather up with water and form into foam texture. I like to ensure my face is damp before I use this and and once again use this as a foam. I generally gently rub this around my face for about min before rising off. I find this allows time for the product to work. With my skin type I can not use this daily, as I find it too stripping. I will gently use this once or twice a week depending on the condition of my skin. ( please note if this is drying your skin out and cause a break out, please stop and give it as rest as you are over using the product and breaking your skin barrier)",

Many were extremely expensive, or were only available in the US. I'm so glad I found this cleanser. I've now been using it for a month alongside my minocycline acne pills (lower level accutane like drug), and have found amazing benefits. -reduced redness -less swelling -smaller breakouts -less common breakouts -less oily skin -reduced appearance of sebaceous filaments Would definitely recommend this cleanser if you struggle with oily skin and acne.",

The ml bottle lasts for a long time, which makes it an excellent investment for skin care. In addition, I like the fact that Roche-Posay is a trusted brand with a long story in skin care.

I highly recommend it to all people who want to have a uniform complexion, a healthy face without spots. You can use it for night cleaning, to remove any makeup or sunscreen, and for morning cleaning. I'm surprised by this. The cleanser is also very silky when applied to your skin, and does not leave you dry or tight as many cleansers do. By the way, I have combination skin. I noticed that my usual greasy spots have calmed down somewhat. I don't regret this choice, I love this cleansing gel.",

        "review": "For a few months now I () have been suffering from a somewhat shiny and pimple -tending skin, although I never had skin problems before.Probably due to stress. Coincidentally, I got to a rehearsal of this washing gel and I liked it incredibly very much when I used it for the first time.Usually my skin tenses very much after using a washing gel and does not feel good, which forced me to apply cream and that has only worsened the shine of the skin.As a result, I only used a washing gel every few days in the morning. The Effaclar, on the other hand, does not dry out the skin at all, thanks to the pH-neutral consistency.Applying is no longer absolutely necessary after use - the skin feels fresh and gently cleaned.I have used it about - times so far. The most important thing - and I absolutely cannot understand how some ladies and gentlemen can deny it!- I have had no shiny skin since the first application.The pimples have almost disappeared.In the morning I see a little red dot in the mirror, but you can't call it a pimple. I can absolutely recommend it to anyone who also suffers from a somewhat greasy (post -pubescent) skin!The money is definitely worth it!:-) PS: I use the facial cleaning brush from Olaz.Also recommended warmly!",

Within a couple of days of using this once a day they were gone. Skin felt really tight after first use. Not sure if this is good for sensitive or dry skin. I did notice some areas of my face were really dry after the use. I don't use it everyday now.

        "review": "La Roche-Posay's face wash stands out as a refreshing and gentle option for daily skincare routines. Having incorporated it into my regimen, I've found several aspects of the product to be commendable. Firstly, its gentle formulation is a standout feature. Suitable for sensitive skin, it cleanses effectively without causing irritation or dryness, making it a reliable choice for daily use. The absence of harsh ingredients ensures a soothing experience, particularly for those prone to sensitivity or redness. Moreover, the face wash's effectiveness in removing impurities and excess oil is noteworthy. Despite its mild nature, it lathers well and effectively cleanses the skin without stripping away its natural moisture barrier. This leaves the skin feeling clean, refreshed, and balanced after each use. Additionally, the inclusion of La Roche-Posay's signature Thermal Spring Water adds an extra layer of hydration and comfort to the cleansing experience. This unique ingredient helps to soothe and soften the skin, contributing to a refreshed and revitalized complexion. The packaging is practical and user-friendly, with a convenient pump dispenser that ensures easy and mess-free application. The product's dermatologist-tested and fragrance-free formula further adds to its appeal, making it suitable for a wide range of skin types, including those with sensitivities or allergies. However, while the face wash excels in cleansing and soothing the skin, it may not be the most effective option for removing heavy makeup or waterproof products. In such cases, a double cleanse or additional makeup remover may be necessary. In summary, La Roche-Posay's face wash is a reliable and gentle cleanser that effectively cleanses the skin without compromising its delicate balance. Suitable for daily use, it offers a refreshing and soothing experience, making it a staple in any skincare routine.",

        "review": "I have combination to oily skin. Before using La Roche Posay, I had bumps all over my forehead because of my bangs (which I've had for over years) and I got so disgusted looking at my forehead I needed to do something about it and invest in a good cleanser that was inexpensive. I used to use St. Ives, Clean and Clear, and Neutrogena then my friend let me try some of her La Roche Posay products and I absolutely loved it and bought this cleanser ASAP. After using this cleanser for about two weeks I noticed a difference in my skin and it was clearing up (especially my forehead). I was happy with my purchase. It's super gentle on my sensitive skin and the product lasts a long time. After three months of using this product I found out what works for me. Some tips and tricks with using this product - Know your skin type!!! - Remove any makeup before washing your face - rinse your face with warm water and wash the cleanser off with warm water. After washing, splash your face with COLD water - Make sure to activate the product in your hands before applying it on the face, don't apply it directly after taking the product out - wash your face for a sold minute and a half to ensure a good cleansing - ALWAYS MOISTURIZE RIGHT AFTER CLEANSING OR CONTINUE WITH YOUR SKIN CARE ROUTINE - If you're more combo than oily, only use this cleanser once a day or else it will dry our your skin. If you want to cleanse twice a day, invest in a lighter formula of this cleanser. If you don't moisturize right after or continue with your skin care routine, you won't notice a visible difference. Always hydrate the skin after cleansing. If you're looking for immediate results, this might not be your product. For me with most products, I notice a difference after consistent uses up to two weeks. Patience is key with trying new skin care products because your skin needs to get used to what you're putting on it. Knowing your skin type helps a lot too with finding cleansers and products that will suit your skin needs. Overall, this cleanser from La Roche Posay works for me and I absolutely love the results from it. If you're not into scents or smells, this product has a very light scent. Not fruity, or strong just smells refreshing.",

        "review": "I bought this face wash in hopes of clearing up a lot of unsightly blemishes... it did just that, for the most part. When first opening the bottle, I was really put off by how fragranced the gel wash is. It's not a bad smell (very perfume-y), but highly fragranced face washes tend to dry my skin out (which it did eventually). For the first month and a half, I used this with an exfoliating battery operated facial brush since my skin doesn't self-exfoliate very well. It worked okay with getting make up and everything, but I was still breaking out a lot. I kept using the wash but opted to use it sans-facial brush. This seemed to work a lot better, and didn't dry my face out as much. For about another months, my skin was pretty great. Until the colder weather came around and it sucked any remaining moisture out of my skin. Basically - it's a nice facial cleanser for the warmer months. It's good for getting makeup and sweat/oil off, but does tend to dry my combination skin out.",

        "review": "My little story for those who are interested: I have been suffering from impure skin for about my th year.My back, cleavage and my face were totally greasy and covered with many pimples.Unfortunately I was young and naive and due to very lack of hygiene I didn't take care of it, unfortunately my mother wasn't.At the age of I thought about it and looked at which skin type I correspond.Unfortunately I always typed on dry skin, it was totally wrong.Accordingly, I also bought products for dry or combination skin, which of course only led to the fact that my skin dried out extremely and I then produced more sebum, my pores clogged and of course I got more pimples.So as you can see, I was very stupid. I tried a lot of products from drugstores and everyone is somehow shit, especially there are only products for dry, very dry or combination skin.I then made myself smart on the Internet and found that I was suffering from greasy skin, so I started looking for products. About the product: I came across La Roche-Posay and read a lot about it.It was very convincing me so I bought the cleaning gel, a cream, a peeling and an anti-pimple cream.You have to say something went on the money (approx. ) but I assure you it was extremely worth it.I have had the products for a week and I see more and more difference every day.Sure, it always takes time, but you notice a very good result in time.As I said, I had to do with many products and it usually only worsened the result.It is very pleasant, it smells good and the skin does not grease, I use the gel in the morning and in the evening and then also the anti-pimple cream. My little tip: I am very convinced and can really recommend it who suffers from greasy/oily skin with improve and pimples. Please check first of which skin type you have since you put the wrong products.If nothing helps you, a visit to the skin doctor is necessary, especially for people who suffer from acne, let yourself be examined regularly, it is not to be trifled with it and pay attention to how you eat, so a McDonald's visit is better to avoid, or chips and other sweets.",

I even use it to remove myself, since it does not irritate my eyes (carefully, of course) and daily.I would say that the duration of the boat could be - months without any problem. The results: The first photo I put is before treatment, the second is about months later.I practically do not have any scar (I do not wear makeup in the photos), and the outbreak has disappeared. I recommend it very much, next to the moisturizer I have commented before.",

The best thing about this product, however, is that it is gently to the skin and at the same time is very effective against pimples and other impurities.The active ingredient salicylic acid is a real miracle cure against blackheads and other skin problems.The cleaning gel leaves my skin refreshed and maintained without it feeling dry or irritated. I was particularly impressed by the effect of panthenol / vitamin B.It stores moisture and significantly improves the appearance of my skin.I noticed that my skin feels smoother and radiant since I used this cleaner. The application is very simple and quick.I moisten my face with lukewarm water and then distribute a hazelnut -sized amount of the cleaner on my fingertips.I gently massage it into my face with circular movements and around my eyes before I wash it down thoroughly. The best thing about this cleaner is that it is suitable for all skin types, even for sensitive and dry skin.The gel contains no sharp ingredients and is water -soluble.It does not dry out my skin and is perfect for facial cleaning in the shower or in the bathtub. I am also very happy that all Paula's Choice products are perfume -free and are never tested on animals.That gives me a good feeling and I can use the products with a clear conscience. In summary, I can only say that the Clear facial cleaner from Paula's Choice is an absolute top product.It is effective, gently with the skin and for all skin types.I can recommend it to anyone looking for a reliable cleaner who fights impurities and pimples and at the same time maintains the skin.",

Also contains SA albeit in small amounts and has to be washed off (compared to other more effective topical leave-on SA products). However, the bottle is absolutely terrible; first of, it leaks when traveling so you have to make sure it is ALWAYS in an upright position so traveling abroad with this thing is a no-no (unless you don't mind a leakage). Secondly, the bottle cap broke a month after using it and I didn't even do anything to it, no twisting, no opening/closing - it just broke off. If you have a different bottle you can decant the product into - go for it. Otherwise, expect breaks, leakages, etc. when getting this product.",

It did wash off makeup when I used it which was great but I didn't buy it for the purpose of removing makeup. There was no strong scent which is good but it didn't perform to what the other reviews had mentioned. I won't be repurchasing again.

One of the strong points of this foaming gel is its balanced formula, enriched with salicylic acid, white clay, ceramids and niacinamide.These ingredients target imperfections while respecting the integrity of the skin.I noted a visible reduction in imperfections after a few weeks of regular use. What I also appreciate is its neutral smell.Unlike certain similar products which can be too flavored or chemical, this foaming gel leaves no persistent odor, which makes it pleasant to use on a daily basis. The texture of the foam gel well without being excessive, and it rinses easily, leaving a feeling of lasting cleanliness.I highly recommend this product to all those who seek to purify their skin while reducing imperfections, without attacking their epidermis. In summary, this foaming gel of Cerave is an excellent choice for skins with acne tendency.It offers deep cleaning, a feeling of freshness and visible efficiency on imperfections.",

A ml originally felt small but after using it twice daily for a few weeks, the bottle is still more than half full - an incredible deal for the price it's set at. This means it'll surely last a while. In terms of effectiveness, the product itself works wonders even after a single use. It leaves the skin feeling and looking soft and helps to deal with possibly embarrassing spots and clogged pores. In my case, it effectively removed excess oils and made the skin look great. Of course, it doesn't entirely get rid of spots - it's not magic! However, in my case, it has helped to at least reduce the amount of them or conceal them a bit. For my oily skin, it removed the oils and made the skin feel soft rather than moisturise but this may be different on different types of skin.",

Another great advantage is the price.Cerave is quite affordable compared to many other products on the market, even though it really offers high quality.So you have the feeling of using a premium product without having to spend a fortune.The application is also very simple: the consistency is pleasant, it is easy to apply and also easily washed off.The smell is also very discreet, which I personally find very pleasant because I don't like strong perfumes on my face.All in all, I am really enthusiastic about Cerave and will definitely continue to use it.It has really raised my skin care routine to a new level and I can recommend it to anyone who has to struggle with impure skin or dryness!",

        "review": "Since I started using the Cerave Gel Cleaner Imperfections, my skin has improved markedly.This cleaner gel is specially formulated for skin with acneic and fat tendency, and I can say that it has been an excellent addition to my facial care routine.The gel contains salicylic acid, which helps reduce acne outbreaks, minimize black points and clean the pores in depth.The best thing is that, although it is effective, it does not dry out the skin like other products with salicylic acid that I have tried. The texture of the gel is soft and pleasant, and leaves no sticky sensation or strap after using it.Being without fragrance and with a non -comedogenic formula, it is ideal for sensitive skin.After a few weeks of use, I have noticed that acne shoots are less frequent and my skin looks more balanced and soft.In addition, the size of ml is perfect, since it lasts a long time and gives me a good performance for the price.If you are looking for an effective, smooth and accessible cleaner to control acne and improve skin texture, the Cleaning Cleaning Gel Imperfections Control is an excellent option.I totally recommend it!",

        "review": "I have been using the Cleanser control clea and honestly for a while, it has been a positive change in my skin care routine.As someone who fights with imperfections and excess fat, I am always looking for products that keep my skin clean without resecting it.This cleaner has pleasantly surprised me, and here I explain why. Deep and soft cleaning Something that I loved from this product is how it gets a deep cleaning without leaving dry skin or strap.I have tried other acne cleaners, but many of them are usually quite aggressive.Instead, the Cerave cleaner manages to clean the pores and control the sebum without causing irritation.After using it, I feel fresh and clean skin, but I don't have that uncomfortable feeling of extreme dryness.It is a difficult balance to find in acneic skins, and here I think they have succeeded. Active ingredients and their benefits This cleaner has a combination of ingredients that works very well.One of the main ones is salicylic acid, which is ideal for disobstructing pores and preventing new outbreaks.Being a chemical exfoliant, I do not need to use physical scrubs that can be too abrasive.I feel that salicylic acid helps me keep my skin clean and with fewer black points, something that is always a challenge. In addition, it has niacinamide, which is an ingredient that I like a lot.Niacinamide helps to calm the skin and reduce redness, which is perfect if you have acne and a bit irritated skin.It also regulates excess fat, so I have noticed that my skin is less bright throughout the day. Finally, something that seems to me a strong point is the ceramids.They are lipids that help maintain intact skin barrier, and this is crucial in cleaning products.Many times, acne products can damage the cutaneous barrier and leave the skin more vulnerable, but thanks to ceramides, I notice that this cleaner is more respectful and keep my skin balanced. Texture and feeling when using it The texture is another aspect that I like.It is a gel that rubbing it on the face becomes a light foam.It is not too foamy, which I appreciate because I feel that it is distributed well without being abrasive.After rinsing it, I notice that my skin feels very fresh and with a deep cleaning, but without that strap sensation that some cleaners leave. Results that I have noticed With regular use, I have seen improvements in my skin.The outbreaks are less frequent and when they appear, they are less severe.I also feel that the texture of my skin is softer and more uniform, probably due to the effect of chemical exfoliation of salicylic acid.I like that it is a product that I can use every day without worrying that the skin would dry out or irritate. Ideal for my skin type Although this cleaner is designed for skin with acneic tendency, I think it works well for various skin types, especially if you have mixed or fat.My skin is mixed and I usually have excess fat problems in the T zone, but with this cleaner I notice that sebum control is effective.Even if you have sensitive skin, I think it would work well because it is quite soft and has soothing ingredients. Quality-price ratio As for the quantity, the container brings ml, which seems quite generous.I need very little product every time I use it, so a bottle lasts a lot.Considering the quality of the ingredients and the results I get, I think it has an excellent value for money.In addition, Cerave is a brand known for its effective and soft formulas, so I have confidence in its products.",

The foam cleanser helped but I'd still get break outs every so often. This bleamish control one has done the job so far, I've not had any further break outs since using this one so it's great and I'm about to purchase my second bottle of this one. There's no scent, it keeps my skin hydrated, where as the foam cleanser did dry it out quite a bit. This bottle is slightly smaller but it's still great value for money for the quality of the product and it leaves my skin really soft. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone.",

        "review": "I started using this Cera detergent about two weeks ago, hoping to improve my skin that tends to be oily with some imperfection here and there.I immediately liked the fact that it had no strong or annoying perfumes: it is very delicate on the skin, even if it contains salicylic acid. After the first few days, I noticed that the skin seemed cleaner and less shiny, especially in the T area. It does not make immediate miracles (do not expect to wake up with the perfect skin from one day to the next), but with constant use you can see improvements.It seems to me that the pores are less evident and that imperfections dry faster. The texture is interesting: a gel that does not make a lot of foam, but that rinses easily without leaving residues.And the purifying clay is a nice touch, because it does not dry the skin as I thought, which I appreciate very much since my skin is mixed and sometimes sensitive. The only thing is that, if you use it too often or without moisturizing well after, it can leave the skin a little pulled.I use it once a day, in the evening, and so far it is going very well. Points in favor: Check the lucidity well and leave the skin clean. It does not irritate, despite the active ingredients. Perfect for mixed or fat skin. Points to improve: The package is a little small for the price, but it takes little. Better to use it together with a good moisturizing cream to avoid dryness. In general, it is a product that I recommend to those who want to take care of the skin without complicating their lives too much.Just have a little patience to see the results!",

First of all, salicylic acid acts gently to exfoliate and smooth the skin, while unconstructing the pores.White clay effectively purifies the skin and helps reduce excess sebum, which is ideal for people struggling with acne problems. The presence of niacinamide in this product is really appreciated, because it offers an anti-inflammatory action that soothes the skin and reduces redness (unlike certain brands with aggressive soap).In addition, hyaluronic acid hydrates deeply, leaving the skin soft and flexible (more dry skin!). What I particularly liked was that this product manages to remove impurities from the skin without drying it.This is essential to prevent the appearance of pimples and maintain an optimal balance of skin hydration.However, I recommend using it once twice a day for better results, because too much use produces the opposite effect!(It is not by cleaning the skin several times a day that you will reduce the acne, you must clean it in the morning and in the evening - for my part only in the evening because I do not have very oily skin) Finally, what seduced me in this product is to be able to find everything you need to limit acne without having to buy lots of product without advised skincare.I couldn't have several products anymore and I finally found what suited me.No longer clean your skin with Marseille soap hoping to remove the sebum, take this soap instead :)",

        "review": "I have really awkward skin - eczema on my eyelids, dry skin all over my face, but spot prone around my chin (thanks to endometriosis). I have been using this face wash alongside the cerave oil free spf day moisturiser, cerave retinol serum, and cerave oil free night moisturiser for a couple of months now and my skin seems the best it has in ages. Takes off makeup fairly easily (sometimes I have to double wash to remove all mascara or dark lipstick). No smell. Does not irritate my eczema or dry skin. Leaves my skin feeling clean. No skin burns to my cheeks (which I am really prone to due to my sensitive skin!) Good size bottle and pump is still working well. Will be re-purchasing when I run out but still have loads left.",

        "review": "The Cerave Gel has been an excellent addition to my facial cleaning routine.After several weeks of use, I have noticed a clear improvement in the texture of my skin, especially in terms of reducing imperfections.What I like most is that, despite being a product for the control of imperfections, I do not dry my skin, something that usually happens with other similar cleaners.On the contrary, my skin feels clean but soft and balanced after each use. The gel has a pleasant consistency and is easily rinsed, leaving a feeling of freshness without being aggressive.It contains salicylic acid, which helps to exfoliate gently and keep the pores clean, which is a plus. The only thing I would like to improve is that the results, although notable, are not immediate and constancy is required to see a significant reduction in imperfections.However, the formula is soft enough to use it every day without causing irritation, which for me is a key point. In general, it is a very effective cleaner, especially if you have mixed or fat skin and look for a product that controls imperfections without compromising the natural hydration of the skin.Highly recommended!",

It leaves a fresh, clean feeling and ensures a more even complexion.With dry skin, however, it could be a little too strong because it does not provide enough moisture.For my skin, which tends to impurities, it is perfect and has visibly improved my skin. Overall, I am very satisfied with the Cerave cleaning gel.It offers a mild but effective cleaning that does not dry out even when used daily.Absolutely recommended for those who are looking for a gentle but thorough cleaning for combination skin or greasy skin.",

        "review": "Excellent quality/price, it cleans really well but at the same time thanks to the ceramids does not dry out and cracks the skin but like any other detergent of any brand containing salicine acid or otherwise do not expect to resolve acne, dilated pores and excessive sebum production (anointed leather) with only this product because the miracles do not exist.Cerave does excellent detergents like this but on my skin the anti -imperfections and retinal gel only useless states, a slight improvement of the acne yes and some less visible wrinkles but nothing more, dilated pores, blackheads and production of sebum perhaps some of these even worse especially after the application of the product post imperfections (retinol) greased to Gogo.After having passed out to inquire, I solved with salicine acid, niacidamide and azelaic acid.The first two are the Bha Paula Choice (needless to look for a cheaper version does not exist equal to % that is of real active ingredient and not a more bland and delicate derivative of it) and Skin Balancing tonic always of the same brand and finally the fundamental for those suffering from acne like me bionike aknet azelaic plus (only in the evening because it also has the retinol), recently I also added a serum with vitamin C as vitamin CLast step to improve skin tone.",

You will need a moisturiser after using as with any skin wash routine, I feel like it can be quite drying on the skin and leave the skin feeling tight, but thats just completely normal. A moisturiser or Vaseline will make up for this. I also pair with a subtle toner by the same brand, I wont be buying anything else from now on, its long lasting, clear light gel, easy pump to use that gives you little at a time, great smell and works perfect for my skin. Ingredients are a bonus and safe. And the price is absolutely great, some other natural brands can be a bit quite expensive. So its always easy to top up when I need to!",

As for scent, there isn't much of one, which is grreat because I don't need to \"perfume\" my face. Rinses off nicely. I still can use my molisturizer and my face doesn't feel \"heavy\". Just one pump, or less, does the job. And I really love that you can use it in the shower - so many of them you must use over the sink. I've already ordered more to have on hand.

I have been using Sukin products for around two years now so I've really given them the test of time. I use three products religiously: the Micellar Cleansing Water, the signature Facial Moisturiser, and this foaming facial cleanser. They are all equally excellent and are the only skincare products I use at all. Throughout my life I have been prone to breakouts and extremely sensitive skin. If I ever try and switch out my skincare and try other products, it immediately breaks out. Sukin is the only brand that my skin has ever responded well to, and my skin has never become 'bored' of it so to speak, it has produced consistently good results for the entire two years I have been using it. This cleanser removes makeup SO well, I just use it in the shower and scrub it onto a face full of makeup and it removes EVERYTHING, including stubborn mascara and eyeliner - just make sure you rub it in and make it nice and foamy. It is honestly amazing and leaves my skin feeling fresh, clean and healthy. I would recommend all Sukin products always.",

Initially, I enjoyed using it daily, appreciating its ability to effectively remove dirt and impurities without drying out my skin as much as some cleansers do. However, only a day after my first use I noticed a minor reaction of flakiness around my eyes and nose. This was most likely from one of the ingredients as this has happened to me before. This may only be a rare issue but if you have sensitive skin I recommend patch testing it a day before use. Despite this reaction, I recognize that skincare products can vary in their effects from person to person. While the Sukin Foaming Facial Cleanser may not have been suitable for my skin, it still offers effective cleansing properties and natural ingredients that may benefit others.",

The smell isn't great. When I opened the bottle and took the pump out, it did smell like lemon meringue as another reviewer had stated. But when, actually pumped out and added to water, the smell changes for some bizarre reason and isn't great. It was more expensive than other brands for the same amount, so not economical. I bought this as my usual brand is unavailable, so I thought I would give this a try as it stated is was a FOAM cleanser. The description is very misleading. A foam cleanser should be foam as it is pumped out of the bottle. This is just a liquid soap. The manufacturer should take note that for it to be a foam cleanser, you need a foaming pump to convert the liquid into foam. The pump provided is not the correct pump for converting the liquid into a foam. Sort it out. I would not recommend this, due to the false advertising of the product.",

        "review": "Thayers facial cleansing with Aloe Vera is a product that adapts perfectly to those with dry, oily or mixed skin, and looks for a delicate but effective detergent. The presence of Aloe Vera makes it particularly moisturizing, while its light and non -aggressive formula is ideal for daily use. One of the characteristics that struck me most is the ability to cleanse without leaving the skin dry or tense, as often happens with other detergents. After application, the face is fresh and clean, without that feeling of \"pit skin\", which is a common problem for those with dry or sensitive skin. For those with oily skin, it helps to adjust the excess of sebum without depriving the skin of its natural hydration. The consistency is creamy and pleasant, and a small amount is enough to obtain a good foam.Aloe vera has a calming effect that reduces any redness or irritation, making it suitable also for those with more reactive skin or with acne trends. After several weeks of use, I noticed that my skin appears more balanced, with less lucidity in the T area and a general improvement in appearance. It is an excellent detergent for those looking for a versatile product, capable of hydrating and purifying at the same time, without attacking the skin. In conclusion, the face cleansing Thayers with Aloe Vera is a perfect lotion for those who want a delicate, moisturizing product and suitable for all skin types, with a natural formulation that do not compromise the effectiveness of daily cleansing.",

It's unscented and doesn't foam, which I like. It's just a clear calming gel. Also, a little goes a long way. I've been using it for months and it's still gonna last for over a year, so it's well worth the price. I did wait for it to go on sale before I bought it, so I'm pleased with my purchase. Also like that it has a pump, but you need to pump it carefully without too much pressure. Otherwise, a lot squirts out.",

My usual go to face wash is Nivea for combination skin with ph balancing properties and it has worked as required on my skin for years meaning, does not leave skin too greasy in Summers and doesn't leave skin too dry in winter months. The positives for Thayer's is that a tiny bit goes a long way and is unscented. This bottle would easily last me longer than months. Overall it's good.",

However, if you're like me and eventually have to switch products because your face gets used to it and it doesn't work anymore, that will happen with this aswell.",

Don't let the picture of the old bruly man that looks like he's a relic scare you. Perhaps someone that might look like your grandfather. But anyways this cleaner is probably \"unisex\" so far even though you have an old mysterious man in your washroom. My daughter says beyond it being creepy, this facial cleaner works very well and leaves her skin feeling soft and smooth. Now if I wish that there was something to clean her attitude but again that's another story for another day. Thanks for reading from your \"Unfluential Influencer\". Happy Shopping.",

It took a while for me to find as I was testing out different cleansers, but Thayers has since come out on top as my replacement choice. While it doesn't smell as good as Maapilim's face cleanser did, it's the only product I've come across since that has felt the best on my skin and provided the most consistent results for my face. Plus, I really like that they have aloe vera in the cleanser formula and that the bottle itself has a pump dispenser as well. Those were a big plus in my book!",

Had tried a few foaming cleaners from stores that ended up either too creamy, not enough froth or sud, broke put skin, etc. Decided to try this based on reviews. It foams up nicely. Only small amount of product needed so should last a long time (I recommend gently squeezing out only a small pee size. This product cleaned my face well. Cleared up much of the breakouts from all the other products I tried. Rinsed well. Has a scent but not overpowering & did not bother my skin. I use this sometimes alone & sometimes with a buffing face pad/or wash cloth for exfoliation. It cleaned my pores without overdrying my skin. My only regret is that I did not try this years ago when it st came out. I will definitely continue to use this product. Oh, and the tube is huge! For reference, I'm grandma age but this also works well for the young adults as well. Probably would e good for a teen with acne too as it cleans well without stripping & overdrying skin which in turn if that happens, skin produces more oil to make up for it. Try it. What do you have to lose.",

One of the things I appreciate the most is how it helps reduce the appearance of pores, giving my skin a smoother and more refined look. Additionally, this cleanser is highly hydrating and moisturizing, ensuring that my skin feels soft and nourished after each wash. Unlike many other cleansers that can leave the skin feeling tight or dry, this one maintains the perfect balance of cleansing and hydration. It is mild and suitable for daily use, making it an excellent choice for anyone who wants a cleanser that is both effective and gentle. I have always loved rice-based skincare products, as they work exceptionally well for my skin type and consistently deliver amazing results. This cleanser is no exception! It comes in a generously sized pack that lasts for months, making it cost-effective and worth every penny. I use it twice a day, every single day, and my skin has been benefiting greatly from it. Overall, I am extremely happy with this product and would highly recommend it to my friends and family. If you're looking for a cleanser that cleans deeply, minimizes pores, hydrates well, and lasts long, this is worth trying!",

The oz size is actually huge (looks like a small shampoo bottle almost), I underestimated all the review pictures. Plus, this product goes such a long way for such a small amount of it, I find myself barely squeezing the bottle for each use. I use this product with an exfoliating silicone pad. Its not over drying. Like most products Ive used, if I dont apply moisturizer right after, my skin becomes bone dry and uncomfortable/tight but not with this face wash. My face actually feels glowy and bouncy. Worth it in my opinion.",

Will continue to use it at night until i experience breakouts or anything bad. It deeply cleansed my skin leaving it very clean and did remove all of my makeup and oil. Its amazing so far and i didnt get any rashes from it ( yet ) the picture shows a lot of yellow ingredients highlighting that it can cause irritation and dryness.

Pros: -A little goes a LONG way -The lather is rich -The price is fair -My super oily skin has been so much less oily...like through the following day! Ive never experienced something that has worked like this at reducing oil. Cons: -It burns my skin...not in a visibly noticeable way, but I can definitely feel it. Im definitely going to keep using it to see longer term results. I can handle the burning especially since the oil control is phenomenal. Hoping it doesnt cause me to break out or anything because I think this face wash has great potential.",

The formula is super gentle on the skin and has a soothing, non-irritating feel, which is perfect for my sensitive skin. It effectively removes dirt and impurities without leaving my face feeling dry or stripped. The texture is smooth and easy to apply, and it has a mild, pleasant scent. A little goes a long way, so the bottle lasts quite a while. My skin feels really soft and hydrated after use. The only reason Im giving it stars instead of is that it doesn't lather as much as other cleansers Ive used, which might be a drawback for those who prefer a foamy wash. That said, its still a great product and has worked well for me overall. Highly recommend for anyone looking for a gentle, hydrating cleanser!",

        "review": "After using minimalist oat extract face wash for about a month, Im extremely satisfied with my experience. Pros: - Gentle on the skin, doesnt make it dry - Skin feels clean despite not making any lather - Doesnt contain any fragrance which shows they havent added any artificial, unnatural fragrances in the product - True to their name, their packing is also minimal which is great to see. Other than the product container which is plastic, there is no other plastic used at all in the packaging which is fantastic Cons: - Slightly expensive but worth it. Else, I would say no cons so far Points to note: - It doesnt form any lather - It doesnt have any fragrance Overall experience: Definitely recommend this product to those with dry/sensitive skin and those looking for a product with minimal chemicals. To my dry skin, it has given a decent all-weather face wash option. I hope they come up with a larger bottle as well Tips for other buyers: As it doesn't form any lather, it will get some time to get used to it and to know how much quantity to use. If you found this review helpful, please give it a thumbs up! , : - , - - , - , , | ( ) , , : - , : - : / , , : , , , !",

        "review": "Im going to try to be as honest as possible because I am peeved at the same time understand that things happen. Upon opening my Amazon package, I found that half of my cleanser had spilled into the box, making it soggy and also obviously wasting half of the product. The product itself is lovely. I have combination skin that leans dry, so I need a cleanser that is thorough but doesnt dry out. So far after my first two uses, this seems to be it. My skin feels clean but I dont have that tightness or dryness that I do with harsher cleansers. I dont feel like I need to run for moisturizer immediately after and I cant see my pores as prominently. That being said, my only customer service option was to return the defective item to Amazon. For $., this seems excessive to me and quite frankly more trouble (for myself and the environment) than just taking the L. So product gets / so far, Amazon third-party seller customer service gets / stars.",

I have used both for an equal period of time, and as a teenager with combination and acne prone sensitive skin, This is my holy grail!! In consistency, job, and ingredients this one is even better than Cetaphil one. Plus it's cheaper than it. It has hyaluronic acid, bisabolol and vitamin b, all great hydrators and balancers for combination skin. Plus no fragrance or any essential oils. This lasts for months. I gave subscribed to it to get it delivered once every months now (-:",

        "review": "I have very sensitive combination skin. The product did not irritate my skin in any way and was decent at cleansing. It doesn't have much noticeable scent, which is nice. However, I found it difficult to use efficiently. It's rather thin and doesn't lather/foam/thicken upon use. So it's not good to use with scrub sponges or cloths. I feel like too much of it slips through my fingers and is wasted. It's not so easy to distribute over my face. Maybe it would work with one of those silicone scrubbers? I will use what I have, but will keep looking for something that is a bit creamier or lathers a tiny bit to make it easier to apply.",

This does just that. It doesnt strip my skin and preps it nicely for the more important steps in my routine (I.e actives and serums). It also leaves my face with a soft glow after using. Sometimes, if Im wearing light makeup or a sunscreen only, I even find that I can skip oil cleansing and do a double cleanse with this only. Definitely keeping this in my rotation.",

        "review": "This product is NOT for sensitive skin or hypersensitive skin types. The first time I used this my skin within minutes flared up red and became hot to touch. The following day my skin was sore, naturally I was concerned but I had to use it a second time because I wanted to be certain with my concerns. I used this a second time and the same thing happened, the following day my skin was as dry as a bone, red and raised and sore. I am furious because the product boasts Non-Drying Gentle..when thats not the case. Ive used previous % salicylic acid products before, particularly Image Skin but the price of that is a bottle so I chose this based on good reviews and a cheaper price. Well its true, you get what you pay for. Ive returned this for a refund and am having to repair my skin barrier.",

I use this face wash twice daily and each bottle lasts three to four months. Don't think about anything. If you suffer from bad acne mainly cystic acne it will work great for you.",

        "review": "I'm a man in my s with normal to dry skin. I've already used Triden Green face wash, but I was also curious about this so I bought it. The feel of use is as follows. Foam quality You can create a firm foam by removing about -cm and then lathering it with your hands.If you use the internet it might look even more intense.It's almost fragrance-free. You can wash it with air and gently slurp foam, or you can thoroughly whisk it, cover it like a pack, and wash it by pressing the foam. Washing The foam is well-developed and has a refreshing feel, but it doesn't stick, and I get the impression that it still has a moderate moisture content. Since this is the summer season, we will be checking the signs of use in the spring and autumn seasons and dry winter seasons in the future. effect Contains vitamin C to tighten pores!Or, the peeling effect removes dullness!It's not a product that does not have any such features, so I think it would be good for those who want to clean their skin purely. Overall review I have normal skin so I can't help but feel that this kind of product is fine, but I think it's a product that I think isn't bad for anyone who has used it for any age.Oh, and the volume and foaming are very cost-effective. It's a bit of a pain to have multiple face washes, but I think it's recommended as a facial cleanser for everyday use and for skin problems.",

Thought it may have only been for the first time using it out but no, second time was just as frustrating. I am in my s and have no injuries or issues with my hands.

        "review": "This is arguably the best exfoliator I've ever used. Normally, I'm a big fan of Korean skincare as it suits my skin better, but this Paula's Choice BHA exfoliator probably beats any other exfoliator I've used. Within week of using this, the blackheads and whiteheads on my nose? GONE! It doesn't even sting your skin like many other acid based exfoliators I've used. I've even tried this where my skin was uneven. Guess what happened? My skin became as smooth as a baby's bottom! I bought the travel size, which is a bit small (size of my palm). However, you only need one drop a day for results, which is how this tiny bottle lasted me months (and counting!) with half the bottle left. The design of the bottle is also secure, with a little flip top inside the white screw top (which is very good for travelling in my experience). To add, I'm a big fan of making my skincare desk aesthetic, and the minimalistic design of this bottle just tops off how good this exfoliator is. Paula's Choice you've done it again! Pros: - Smooths skin - Doesn't sting AT ALL - Gets rid of blackheads / whiteheads - Secure flip top - Aesthetic bottle Cons: - NONE!",

I had some small spots of purging after starting to use this, but Im not unhappy about it because it just means its working and the area thats been previously untreatable (my chin) is finallyyyy responding to an exfoliant. Ive found through trial and error that my skin responds much better to BHAs than AHAs. The latter are too harsh and strip my skin which is very sensitive and dry. Ive even been using this product almost every night on my chin, which is much more frequently than I usually use exfoliants but somehow its gentle enough not to have me peeling or red and sensitive. Having said that, I dont think I need to use it this often Im just overexcited about the results. I had other paulas choice products, one with BHA in it and I even used the BHA product for a while but they werent nearly as effective as this formula. I will repurchase this and Im so glad I found it after reading reviews!",

I've only used it three times, and it has transformed my skin. I'm a brown girl and hence my skin is naturally dull and has random dark spots. But after just two applications my skin has gotten brighter, clearer, and none of my pores are visible anymore. It is quite strong so you shouldn't use it every day, I use it twice a week. I can literally see my dead skin flaking off so you might want to scrub and moisturizer once that happens to you. I am surely buying the bigger bottle as soon as I'm done with this one.

        "review": "After seeing rave reviews on social media I decided to try this exfoliant, rather than using a toner. I am so incredibly pleased with this product. It wasnt immediate, but I noticed my acne healing quickly and the scars disappear faster than usual. I dont believe that this can prevent acne (thanks to my hormones for that) but it does a fantastic job of managing it. The instructions are to use it up to twice daily, but I found this dried out my skin (which is weird cuz Im so oily). Instead I use it every two days, and I use my benzoyl peroxide treatment on every other day. With a niacinamide serum this just works so well. The only downside is that it smells a bit weird, like vinegar. Nevertheless I am recommending it to anyone who will listen to me! If you suffer from persistent acne i really think Paulas Choice will help you!!",

I was amazed at how much it improved my skin quality. I try to care for my skin and cleanse and moisturise morning and night and use sunscreen, and after one use, Im thinking this might be the product I ensure I never run out of. No idea if it will work on the pigmentation but I would be surprised if it didnt. It is quite runny but easy to apply with fingers. Smells a little sour but after applying moisturiser, I cant smell it anymore. Worth the cost.",

I've been using it for a few months and I don't see any change, I still have a lot of blackheads, whiteheads, etc. My skin has remained the same, greasy and full of pores. I can say that it may have not worked due to me not applying it properly but I don't know how it wouldn't work because of that ... I personally believe it was not worth the money at all as it did not change my skin significantly like everyone else says it does for them. I wouldn't buy it again, also sad it didn't work at all on my skin because it cost a lot for how much there is.",

        "review": "I may have found my new favorite face wash with this gel from La Roche-Posay! I recently discovered this brand, and Im impressed by the high quality and effectiveness of their products, especially at this price point. This face wash is no exception! I use it in the shower, working the gel into a light foam on my face. The results are immediately noticeableafter using it, my skin feels tighter and thoroughly clean. The gel texture is pleasant to apply, spreading easily without creating an overwhelming amount of foam or requiring heavy lathering for good coverage. Paired with a good moisturizer, this face wash truly delivers. Within the first week, Ive noticed clearer pores and an improvement in the appearance of my forehead lines. Ill definitely be repurchasing this face wash!",

One time I had to go into the hospital for a few days admission and I forgot my cleansing milk at home, I only had this product with me. It actually took off my make-up! I couldn't believe my eyes, unlike most face wash that will just wash your face and leave the make-up, la roche-posay mela B took off everything, even my eye make-up! My skin wasn't irritated or stressed. I was so impressed! It contains melasyl and niacinamide so it also takes reduces hyperpigmentation and reduces those awful dark spots on the face leaving your skin soft and baby like. I totally recommend this product, too bad i didn't find it to buy again on amazon.",

It says micro peeling so wait till the weekend because you will get a peel, like after a sunburn but without the pain so be prepared to heavy moisturize and exfoliate the next day. I thought it was pricey for a cleanser not realizing what it was, but I like the brand and it was recommended by my favorite tik tok dermatologist; but definitely worth it.",

        "review": "The La Roche-Posay Mela B Gel is an exceptional product for anyone looking to brighten and even out their skin tone. For optimal results, I recommend applying it after cleansing and toning your skin. Start with a pea-sized amount and gently massage it into your face and neck, allowing it to absorb fully before applying your moisturizer or sunscreen. For best results, use it both morning and night. Consistency is key, so incorporating it into your daily routine will help you see improvements over time. Its also essential to use sunscreen during the day, as the ingredients in this gel can make your skin more sensitive to sun exposure. I've noticed a significant difference in my skins clarity and brightness since I started using this gel. It absorbs quickly and doesnt leave any sticky residue, which is a huge plus. Overall, I highly recommend the La Roche-Posay Mela B Gel for anyone looking to enhance their skincare routine!",

It is a smaller amount than I was used to getting from this company, and has a sorta chemical smell to it, which is not like all of their other products. It looks clear and like the original face wash from the light blue bottle, just not as much. I suppose you shouldnt use as much.",

I like a really deep clean and I found that this left foundation on my face, you really have to scrub to get it all off with this one. It left my skin feeling smooth but not completely clean. Its alright, Id use it again in a pinch.",

I have combination skin with hormonal acne on my chin and sensitive skin too. This cleanser has been brilliant, and hasnt made my skin tight, it feels really soft and supple after use. The pump makes it easy to use and it lasts a long time, and its also cheaper than the brand I was using before. Im converted, highly recommend!",

        "review": "I felt compelled to leave this review after being so impressed by a travel size bottle, I had to buy a bigger version! I think everyone knows the premium quality of CeraVe face products now with their close focus on ceramides and amino acids. They prove to be a brand of particular relevance by being wonderfully affordable and holding tremendous value. This face wash does everything I fell in love with CeraVe for, from being a gentle yet proactive product. The face wash comes out in a cream form which at first appears similar to some other known brands. The main difference, however, comes through once applied to the face at instantly turns into a highly foamy, exfoliating and soothing face wash. Best of all, the creamy texture followed by bubbles feel wondrously hydrating on the skin. As a sensitive skin sufferer, with combination skin, this face wash truly feels just right. It cleanses without stripping too deeply, thus leaving my face feeling supple, especially when using with their face cream. It's been two months of use for me and my skin honestly have not felt more gentle and spot free. I'll admit when it comes to pigments and acne scars, this face wash misses the needed salicylic acid to tackle blemishes. On the other hand, for long-term use, this face wash becomes the best option to achieving clean, balanced skin.",

The consistency is creamy and develops with water into a very creamy foam, which feels very pleasant.Despite the salicylic acid it contains, there was no burning sensation in the eyes.I assume that the concentration is very low, but think it is good that it is included for a very minimal peeling effect.My skin definitely looks a little smoother and better. The price is quite high, so there is a point. Otherwise a highly recommended cleaner.",

        "review": "Having purchased for the purpose of the highly touted hylarounic acid ingredient, this cleanser actually includes salicylic acid. The ingredients can be seen on the packaging to this extent as well as a brilliant breakdown on cidecoder. Most of us with acne issues on prescribed creams and gels including benzoyl peroxide need to be extremely careful of what we add to our skin. Salicylic acid and benzoyl peroxide do not mix well and completely strip the skin of its natural moisture barrier when used together... Which can lead to more problematic breakouts and irritation, hence why we opt for products known to help with dry and dehydrated skin. Hylarounic acid isn't listed in the ingredients for this cleanser, instead its sodium hydroxide which is a cousin to hylarounic acid. Kind of a misleading cleanser experience but you live and learn I guess....! Should definitely state more clearly it includes Salicylic-Acid though. Wouldn't recommend for those of us needing a gentle and or hydrating cleanser and on benzoyl or other drying agents.",

        "review": "I purchased this purely because it was on offer. I'd been curious about it for some time but couldn't decide which one of the Cerave products to buy. Eventually, I chose this one. My skin type is combination, menopausal and sometimes sensitive. I've been suffering for quite some time with awful regular breakouts which have an effect on my confidence. I've tried so many face washes from expensive to cheap but this one has become my absolute favourite. I can't smell any scent to it (which is good) and it has a creamy consistency that lathers up really quickly. After using this my skin feels clean and fresh and doesn't suffer from that horrible tight feeling you sometimes get after washing your face. Also, my multiple spot breakout has practically all but gone in just a matter of days! A first for me. I love it! I'll definitely be buying it again.",

The first impression of this cleaning oil is extremely positive.The light texture feels gently on the skin and leaves a pleasant, not greasy feeling.The wording is enriched with essential ceramids, which help strengthen the natural protective barrier of the skin and to include moisture. The effectiveness of this cleaning oil is impressive.It gently and thoroughly removes dirt, make-up and excess oil from my skin without drying or irritating it.Even waterproof make-up is easily removed while the skin is also supplied with moisture. The versatility of this cleaning oil is also remarkable.It is suitable for all skin types, from normal to very dry skin, and can be easily integrated into my existing skin care routine.I like to use it as a first step in my double cleaning to thoroughly clean my skin and to maintain at the same time. The tolerance of this cleaning oil is another plus.It is free of fragrances and parabens and was developed by dermatologists, which makes it particularly gentle and tolerated for sensitive skin.This gives me the confidence that I use a safe and effective product that is good for my skin. All in all, I can recommend the Cerave moisturizing cleaning oil to anyone who is looking for a gentle and effective cleaning for their skin.With its high -quality wording, gentle effect and tolerance, it is an ideal choice for everyone who strives for healthy and radiant skin.",

Any product I tested this brand has always liked it but this in particular Pros: - It does not burn my eyes, this allowed me to be able to completely remove the make -up residues without problems - does not irritate the skin and does not dry it, which unfortunately I had found with detergents of other brands Against: -let's say that for my skin (mixed with acne trend) I preferred the oily skin version as it has a more complex formula ... I would recommend this for normal skin",

        "review": "After using the moisturizing cleaning oil from Cerave for several weeks, I would like to share my observations. I consider the following to be positive: -Efficient cleaning: Cleaning oil has proven to be effective to remove make-up and dirt from the skin.It has a pleasant texture and can be easily distributed on the skin and massage. - Moisture supply: The product donates moisture.I have tried various cleaners in the past and always had to struggle with a feeling of tension in the skin.This problem did not occur with this product and the skin then feels good. - tolerance: My skin has shown no negative reactions to the product. The cleaning oil also leaves no oil film after washing, but washing it takes a little longer than with other products.Thorough washing is important - otherwise the subsequent products could foam or smear on the skin when applying. The following is neutral for me and not very important: - Smell: I am not a big fan of it, but with a cleaner it is not decisive.The smell is also not particularly strong to perceive. In addition, the cleaner arrived in English and not German this time.That seems to be a matter of luck with the Cerave products. I have already ordered the product twice and would continue to order it in the future.Since the cleaning oil does what it should, I give five stars and can recommend it. Status: ..",

I start off using the Easy Peasy Oil Cleanser (purchased on Amazon) followed by CeraVe Hydrating Foaming Oil Cleanser for Normal to Very Dry Skin prior to applying my skincare products every evening. This cleanser is non drying and none irritating. Please note that the cleanser does not come out of the pump container as a 'foam', the liquid becomes a foam after a small amount of water is added which is great as it is more controllable and less messy. The consistency of the liquid is thick which again makes it much easier to control and the fact that it has a pump is another plus. I personally only use this once per day as I do not find it necessary to use any cleanser in my morning routine. Highly Recommend PRO'S: Pump container giving easy controlled access Only small amount required for whole face and neck Large size Value for money Gentle does not irritate skin so ideal for dry or sensitive skin Addition of Ceramides and Squalane Cons: None so far",

        "review": "Brings off make up really well, takes off all mascara without having to use a flannel or cloth to scrub at my eyes - impressive cleanser. I had previously used Elemiss cleansing balm, this is a more effective cleanser, but it doesnt have that luxury feel that you might be used to if youve been using those kinds of products. Its a very different product, as it does foam up. Can also be used as a body wash, which doesnt leave the skin dry. I got it on a lightning deal, and it was a good price point (around ). Has left my face feeling hydrated, noticeably better skin texture. I really like the product, just wish it had a more spa-like luxury feel - thats the only thing Im missing from it.",

        "review": "I bought the Cerave moisturizing cleaning oil some time ago and so far I am quite satisfied with the product.It definitely deserves four stars, even if there is still room for improvements. First of all, the oil fulfills its main task as a cleaner.It easily removes make-up and leaves a pleasantly clean skin feeling.I have normal to dry skin and this cleaning oil seems to harmonize well with my skin type. In addition, I find the ingredients, especially the Ceramide and Squalan, very attractive.They contribute to strengthening the natural skin protection barrier and help to keep the skin hydrated, which definitely benefits my skin. The fact that this product is paraben -free and perfume -free shows that Cerave attaches importance to skin health and security.This makes it a good option for people with sensitive or allergies. However, the fragrance is not my favorite, although it is natural and not intrusive.I would have liked it to be fragrance neutral or have a more pleasant natural fragrance. I also think that the bottle is a bit large and bulky, which makes it difficult to use.Smaller, more compact packaging would be desirable, especially for travel. Despite these small defects, the Cerave moisturizing cleaning oil is a high -quality product that I can definitely recommend.It offers a gentle but thorough cleaning and cares for the skin while it cleans.",

        "review": "This is a really good cleanser and one Id purchase again. I use this as either my morning cleanser or as a second cleanse in the evening (when double cleansing to remove spf and/or make up). Its not going to remove eye make up, namely mascara easily and it stung my eyes a bit when I tried this. So I use another brands oil cleanser then follow with this cleanser and my skin feels lovely and soft. While I get a bit of tightness (this is my normal) after cleansing its not exacerbated by using this cleanser. The pump makes it easy to use - however you dont need a full pump, a little goes a long way. I got the cleanser on offer so it felt value for money. It really doesnt have any scent - which I appreciate as sometimes unfragranced items can smell a bit funky!",

I checked the ingredients and...they had reformulated it and added ingredients with absolutely no indication or announcement of any kind. I was devastated and my skin is currently still healing from the reaction. I wish I had known so that I could have patch tested it.",

        "review": "As a facial plastic surgeon, I'm constantly seeking out high-quality skincare products that can benefit both my patients and myself. With the rising popularity of K-beauty products, I couldn't resist trying the SKIN Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil. After using this product consistently for several weeks, both morning and night, I feel confident in sharing my thoughts. I have incredibly sensitive and oily skin, which is prone to breakouts and underlying rosacea. Finding a cleanser that doesn't irritate my skin or exacerbate these issues can be a challenge. However, I'm pleased to report that the SKIN cleansing oil works exceptionally well for my sensitive skin. Throughout my use, I have not experienced any irritation or increase in breakouts. One aspect of this cleansing oil that I appreciate is its light scent. Many individuals with sensitive skin, myself included, can be easily irritated by strong fragrances. The SKIN cleansing oil has a very subtle, pleasant scent that doesn't overwhelm or cause any discomfort. It's important to note that proper application and removal techniques are crucial when using an oil cleanser, as improper use can lead to breakouts. To use this product effectively, begin by applying the oil to dry skin and massaging it well. This allows the oil to break down makeup, sunscreen, and other impurities. Next, wet your hands and massage your face again, creating a light emulsion. This step is essential for ensuring that the oil is fully emulsified and can be easily rinsed off without leaving any residue behind. Finally, rinse the product off your face thoroughly with water. I believe that many people experience breakouts with oil cleansers due to improper application or removal techniques, which can leave an oily residue on the skin. I highly recommend the SKIN Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil for anyone looking for a gentle and effective K-beauty cleanser, particularly those with sensitive or oily skin. By following the proper application and removal techniques, you can enjoy the benefits of this cleanser without the risk of breakouts or irritation. The light scent and high-quality ingredients make this product a valuable addition to any skincare routine.",

After using it, my skin feels soft, fresh and well hydrated, without the typical sensation of trench that other cleaners leave.In addition, the product has a soft and natural aroma, which makes it even more pleasant to use.The ml presentation is perfect, since a little product is sufficient for each cleaning, so it lasts a lot.If you are looking for an effective and soft cleaner that respects your skin barrier, the Madagascar Centella Light Cleansing Oil is an excellent option.I recommend it a lot!",

My skin is mixed, but many shiny areas also dry areas.The cleaning oil and the foam cleaner were therefore recommended to me.I ordered both and tried them directly. The fragrance was not what I expected at first - in fact I thought of celery at first.No idea why, because the fragrance is very light and very fine.After the application it was gone and since then it has smelled pleasantly discreetly towards Bergamot. Application and handling are simple, the required amount is also low because both are very productive.My skin needed something to change because it initially reproduced a lot of \"fat\", but this has disappeared with regular use.My skin generally looks brighter, cleaner and I always have a good feeling afterwards.I can only recommend the products! The big plus for me was the development -free development!Since various cities have recently built huge test laboratories (e.g. Augsburg with over , animals !!), I now attach absolutely worth it!",

Not only does it leave our skin feeling clean and refreshed, but it also effectively removes makeup and impurities without any greasy residue. The hypoallergenic formula is perfect for our sensitive skin. We've experienced no irritation or breakouts, which is fantastic. The Centella Asiatica soothes and hydrates our skin, leaving it soft and nourished. One thing that surprised us was how well it works on removing build-up like white and blackheads, especially on my husband's nose. He actually uses it more than I do now because of this! The light texture and refreshing micellar cleansing effect are also great. The . fl. oz (ml) size is generous and will last a long time. Overall, we highly recommend this cleansing oil to anyone looking for a gentle, effective, and soothing cleanser for the whole family! Pros: - Gentle and effective - Hypoallergenic - Removes build-up like white/blackheads - Leaves skin soft and hydrated - No greasy residue Cons: - None so far",

I've been through bottles of it and will continue to buy. It really does an amazing job at removing all dirt and makeup from your skin. I do not feel the need to use a makeup wipe to remove my makeup. Tough things like mascara also just melt off and the impressive part is that I was able to use it near my eyes without any irritation. I can really feel it sucking out all the dirt and gunk out of my face and it emulsifies really well with just a couple drops of water. If you have sensitive skin this product is worth a shot since it's very calming.",

I used to have huge cystic acne all over my chest, back and face, especially around the time of my period but within less than months of using this product, my body acne has completely disappeared and my facial acne has been reduced to tiny bumps that only show up around my period. Make sure to moisturise your skin immediately after using it though coz it tends to dry it out a little. But honestly, I'm probably gonna use this for the rest of my life.

Not only does it truly work for sensitive skin (I've had eczema from skincare products and stress, and I struggle with keratosis pilaris, so I'm really that sensitive), it cleared up my acne and KP on my back and arms in less than days. It's a chemical peel, so daily use isn't really encouraged, but I've used it up to -x a week with no reaction. It leaves my skin feeling feather soft, and any acne/KP that does pop up is smaller and easier to exfoliate with a body scrubber. My bacne has been a bane to my existence since I went through hormonal changes (yay menopause!), but this finally cleared it up with the same results I had with FAB KP Bump Eraser, but for less money, more product, and without the need for pumice. Amazing! The only thing I'm not smitten with is the smell, but it's tea tree oil, so the heady mint smell wasn't a surprise to me and worth it if clears up my skin.",

One thing that I did notice is that it lathers well and it helped with my hyperpigmentation. I noticed after almost finishing the bottle, the skin on my neck was peeling! So just a caution to how often you use it. I pair it with this other kojic bodywash which really helps to even out my complexion. With continued use, I would expect to see results in two to three weeks. Tip: This body wash is good at cleaning and removing grime/sweat but might be a bit drying on the skin for some due to the cosmetic acids AHA, BHA, and PHA. If you find that it dries your skin, follow up with a moisturizing body wash such as Dove Bar or Shea Moisture Soap Bar.",

I didnt see a immediate difference you can feel it which is the softness but as for as acne goes I have had less ingrown and breakouts, but do actively still get them of course a I have a hormone problems so Im still going to be getting breakouts, but using this product it wasnt as bad as before. I sometimes use it on my face not to much and harsh because it gives a tingle sensation like you just brushed your teeth. I also you this with a African net sponge , with a amlatin lotion and medline remedy antifungal cream lotion for my under bust (which helps with under bust sweat breakout and discoloration for my ladies) and it works wonders.",

I used to do this with those face wash moist packs. What a big difference and a real plus is, its more cost efficient to use. Eau Thermale Avene Tolerance, I honestly see and feel a cleaner face, and its very moisturizing, far more than my typical night cleansers and moisturizer. . I would recommend this product highly!

From the first use, I was impressed by how soothing it felt on my skin. This lotion has a lightweight, milky texture that glides on effortlessly. It gently removes impurities without any harsh rubbing, leaving my skin feeling clean, soft, and comfortable. Theres no tightness or dryness afterward, just a fresh, hydrated feeling. What really sets this cleanser apart is its minimalist formula. Its free from potential irritants like fragrances and preservatives, which is perfect for my reactive skin. While it being also non-rinse is a bonus, especially when my skin is feeling extra sensitive. I'm newer to using cleanser that are so, which is the reason behind my review being four stars instead of five. This cleanser has earned a spot in my routine. If you have sensitive or easily irritated skin, I highly recommend giving this a tryits a true skincare staple.",

About weeks post procedure I went back to my Cerave foaming facial cleanser and my face broke out. I went back to the Tolerance and my face quit breaking out so Ive continued to use it and my face looks great. This product is a facial milk. I use it twice a day. It will not remove makeup very well so I switch to a foaming cleanser on days i wear makeup which is not very often. This is now my go-to for every day cleansing.",

Most things we have tried causes acne breakouts, burns the skin or makes eczema worse. This product worked, it keeps flare ups from happening most of the time and when they do its minimal (thats usually because he didnt use the stuff for several days causing a flair up.) The cost of this is financially smart compared to what I have spent on other products. He uses this with the control soothing skin recovery cream.",

        "review": "Everyone with rosacea will find something different works for them. I thought I would try this because it's cheaper than the La Roche Posay toleriane gentle cream dermo-cleanser that I find works the best, but also feels a bit gross on my skin - slimy. I also don't like how mucousy this feels on my skin, but indeed it does the job without causing a flare up, whichs surprises me because if I leave it on like I always do with cleansers, it gets a bit stingy. Some cleansers also blow out my pores and this doesn't do that. My skin doesn't dry out, and my toner and moisturiser would also have a part to play in that, but overall I would definitely recommend people with rosacea who are looking for a cost effective cleanser should give this a try. If it doesn't work, just give it to someone, if you've got a skin condition, it's not worth forging through the rest of the bottle, trust me, you'll wreck your face.",

Also, within week of using this, my oily skin became EXTREME ROUGH and DRY. Skin started PEELING OFF, extreme IRRITATION and REDNESS showed up. No moisturizer could heal my dry skin. I immediately stopped using the cleanser but I still do have a few rough patches here and there on my skin. My skin isn't completely healed from the damage caused by the HARSH CHEMICALS of the cleanser. Please DON'T BUY this one if you have oily yet \"sensitive to chemicals\" skin type, like mine. Instead, opt for tons of natural and organic alternatives out there, which provide better results and lesser skin damage. I WON'T EVER recommend this product to anyone.",

I have always had an oily t zone on my face with a few dry spots here n there on my face too, so i guess we can say i have combo skin........this cleanser had helped massively with my skin, this product really does deliver on what it says it does. I did only rate it stars out of , I wish the product smell were much more nicer for the price you pay. Other than that one negative I will definitely keep continuing using this product, using it for days now and I can see the difference in my skin from blackheads to pimples and dullness gone. My skin looks hydrating and healthy.....yay March I absolutely am so smitten over this face cleanser my face as never been so clear in a long time and the smell of the product I honestly don't care I actually grown to liking it",

The gel is incredibly productive and has a relatively neutral smell, which I really appreciate.It is very well suited for my greasy skin because it cleans thoroughly without drying or irritating the skin. The large ml bottle lasts surprisingly long with regular use, which also makes the product attractive in terms of price.Due to its effectiveness and productivity, I can highly recommend the Avene Cleanance cleaning gel, especially for people with greasy and acne -tending skin.",

        "review": "Avene cleansing gel After a few weeks of use I can finally make a careful review of the product. The cleansing gel presents itself in a practical packaging with a dispenser. The quality/price ratio is excellent and very advantageous. The use does not produce much foam, a sign that it is rich in natural products. It leaves the skin well deterated, soft and, especially in the T area, well opacified. Also suitable for the most sensitive, it takes care of the skin without being aggressive and without creating microlesions.It is also particularly suitable for subjects with various problems, being without irritating chemical agents. The only inconvenience: especially on colder days, I found some dryness of the skin after application, nothing that a nourishing cream cannot solve. I will continue to use it!Avene is a guarantee.",

All in all a solid product, but for me not a post-purchase candidate.",

It removed a full face of makeup quite easily and left my skin feeling clean and refreshed. Over the past three days of use my skin has gotten softer and softer.

I could tell I wouldn't need much more so I added a half pump more. So . pumps total, I could have easily only used . or pump. It felt so nourishing on my skin. Like most other double cleansing oils,any times it can leave your vision a little \"foggy\" for a moment after using, an annoying but harmless side effect. But to my surprise, I didn't have that experience at all. Every product cleansing oil I've tried has always done that to me. So already it was a plus for me. I'm gently on my eye area so I don't hurt my eyelashes or delicate and thin skin in the eye area..I gently press my fingertips onto the eyelids to \"melt\" makeup away. I don't ever use a scrubbing motion. This method worked wonderfully as well this time. The cleansing oil spread easily but was not at all runny, nor was it goopy. It was the perfect consistency. No harsh smells or burning or irritating texture against my skin. Great for sensitive and delicate skin. I rinsed my mascara and eyeshadow of easily after seconds of gentle rubbing. No residue left behind and my skin isn't tight and dry and is so wet to the touch. I don't wear much makeup, usually just eyes or long lasting lip color. But I do live in a humid southern USA state and need to get the sticky humid off at the end of a day. Worked wonders. I could have been fine with using just this but I also bought the foam cleanser well and the combination of both was phenomenal for this skincare nerd. I do believe these will last quite some time so makes it great value for the money. Quality skincare and I'm excited to try more of their products! Pics show my eye makeup before applying, after with it on my skin, and after only rinsing it three times. I used a roll of gift wrapping tape for scale of bottle size.. came with a nice an easy to remove sanitary safety clasp to prevent spillage.",

What really impressed me, though, was how soft and smooth my skin felt afterward. No tightness, no greasy residue, just clean, calm skin. It also has a subtle, calming scent that makes the cleansing routine feel almost spa-like. Plus, my pores look more refined and my skin feels more balanced overall. If youre into double cleansing or just want a gentle yet effective oil cleanser, I cant recommend this enough.",

Heartleaf Pore Cleanser: While the cleansers scent was subtle and not overpowering, which I appreciated, the product severely irritated my skin. After using it, I experienced a dramatic breakoutsomething Ive never dealt with before, apart from an occasional pimple. Despite not having sensitive skin, this product left my face in worse condition than ever. I wanted to love this cleanser, but it has completely ruined my skins health. Heartleaf Pore Deep Cleansing Foam: The cleansing foam further worsened my experience. It wrecked my skin barrier, leaving it feeling stripped and vulnerable. Even though my skin is usually resilient and not prone to sensitivity, this product caused dryness and discomfort that I hadnt experienced with other cleansers. Overall, I wouldnt recommend these products, especially for those who value maintaining a healthy skin barrier. While they might work for others, my experience has been nothing short of frustrating and damaging.",

The oil does a great job of removing my makeup and sunscreen, so by the time I follow up with the second wash, it feels like Im really cleaning my skin, instead of just getting whatevers on the surface off. It took at least a month to see any visible improvement in my skin, but now I have less prominent sebaceous filaments and my pores look smaller.

        "review": "Mix feeling on this product, initially I thought it was working well as it was actually pulling sebum and white head out when I am rubbing my nose and face, however after using it for a few week I notice I been getting more pimple/acne. I always wash off and foam cleanse after so there shouldn't be any oil from this cleanser left. I went off this product for a few weeks and tried to use it again and the same thing happen. At this point I gave up and decided to just stick to a foam clenser and skip the oil as this was making my skin worst.",
